"UK retail sales shrug off Brexit fears with February rise

Britain's retailers received a respite from a two-month losing streak when spending in high street stores and online bounced back in February. The Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes were up by 1.4% on January and 3.7% higher than in February 2016. Sterling rose on the currency markets after news of the rise was announced  but the ONS said the bounce back had failed to recoup all the ground lost in December and January. It noted that spending was being curtailed by higher petrol prices.In the three months to February – considered a better guide to the underlying trend than the monthly figure alone – sales were 1.4% lower than in the quarter ending in November.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\biz19.legit.txt

"Is Aspartame Responsible for ‘An Epidemic of Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus’?
I have spent several days lecturing at the WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL CONFERENCE on “ASPARTAME marketed as ‘NutraSweet’, ‘Equal’, and ‘Spoonful”‘. In the keynote address by the EPA, they announced that there was an epidemic of multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus, and they did not understand what toxin was causing this to be rampant across the United States. I explained that I was there to lecture on exactly that subject.

When the temperature of Aspartame exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol ASPARTAME coverts to formaldehyde and then to formic acid, which in turn causes metabolic acidosis. (Formic acid is the poison found in the sting of fire ants). The methanol toxicity mimics multiple sclerosis; thus people are being diagnosed with having multiple sclerosis in error. The multiple sclerosis is not a death sentence, where methanol toxicity is.

In the case of systemic lupus, we are finding it has become almost as rampant as multiple sclerosis, especially Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers. Also, with methanol toxicity, the victims usually drink three to four 12 oz. cans of them per day, some even more. In the cases of systemic lupus, which is triggered by ASPARTAME, the victim usually does not know that the aspartame is the culprit. The victim continues its use aggravating the lupus to such a degree, that sometimes it becomes life threatening.

When we get people off the aspartame, those with systemic lupus usually become asymptomatic. Unfortunately, we can not reverse this disease. On the other hand, in the case of those diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, (when in reality, the disease is methanol toxicity), most of the symptoms disappear. We have seen cases where their vision has returned and even their hearing has returned. This also applies to cases of tinnitus. During a lecture I said “If you are using ASPARTAME (NutraSweet, Equal, Spoonful, etc.) and you suffer from fibromyalgia symptoms, spasms, shooting pains, numbness in your legs, cramps, vertigo, dizziness, headaches, tinnitus, joint pain, depression, anxiety attacks, slurred speech, blurred vision, or memory loss — you probably have ASPARTAME DISEASE!”

People were jumping up during the lecture saying, “I’ve got this, is it reversible?” It is rampant. Some of the speakers at my lecture even were suffering from these symptoms. In one lecture attended by the Ambassador of Uganda, he told us that their sugar industry is adding aspartame! He continued by saying that one of the industry leader’s son could no longer walk – due in part by product usage!

We have a very serious problem. Even a stranger came up to Dr. Espisto (one of my speakers) and myself and said, ‘Could you tell me why so many people seem to be coming down with MS? During a visit to a hospice, a nurse said that six of her friends, who were heavy Diet Coke addicts, had all been diagnosed with MS. This is beyond coincidence.

Here is the problem. There were Congressional Hearings when aspartame was included in 100 different products. Since this initial hearing, there
have been two subsequent hearings, but to no avail. Nothing as been done. The drug and chemical lobbies have very deep pockets. Now there are over
5,000 products containing this chemical, and the PATENT HAS EXPIRED!!!!!

At the time of this first hearing, people were going blind. The methanol in the aspartame converts to formaldehyde in the retina of the eye. Formaldehyde is grouped in the same class of drugs as cyanide and arsenic DEADLY POISONS!!! Unfortunately, it just takes longer to quietly kill, but it is killing people and causing all kinds of neurological problems. Aspartame changes the brain’s chemistry. It is the reason for severe seizures. This drug changes the dopamine level in the brain. Imagine what this drug does to patients suffering from Parkinson’s Disease. This drug also causes Birth Defects.

There is absolutely no reason to take this product. It is NOT A DIET PRODUCT!!! The Congressional record said, “It makes you crave carbohydrates and will make you FAT”. Dr. Roberts stated that when he got patients off aspartame, their average weight loss was 19 pounds per person. The formaldehyde stores in the fat cells, particularly in the hips and thighs.

Aspartame is especially deadly for diabetics. All physicians know what wood alcohol will do to a diabetic. We find that physicians believe that they have patients with retinopathy, when in fact, it is caused by the aspartame. The aspartame keeps the blood sugar level out of control, causing many patients to go into a coma. Unfortunately, many have died. People were telling us at the Conference of the American College of Physicians, that they had relatives that switched from saccharin to an aspartame product and how that relative had eventually gone into a coma. Their physicians could not get the blood sugar levels under control. Thus, the patients suffered acute memory loss and eventually coma and death.

Memory loss is due to the fact that aspartic acid and phenylalanine are neurotoxic without the other amino acids found in protein. Thus it goes past the blood brain barrier and deteriorates the neurons of the brain. Dr. Russell Blaylock, neurosurgeon, said, “The ingredients stimulates the neurons of the brain to death, causing brain damage of varying degrees. Dr. Blaylock has written a book entitled EXCITOTOXINS: THE TASTE THAT KILLS” (Health Press 1-800-643-2665). Dr. H.J. Roberts, diabetic specialist and world expert on aspartame poisoning, has also written a book entitled DEFENSE AGAINST ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE” (1-800-814-9800). Dr. Roberts tells how aspartame poisoning is escalating Alzheimer’s Disease, and indeed it is. As the hospice nurse told me, women are being admitted at 30 years of age with Alzheimer’s Disease. Dr. Blaylock and Dr. Roberts will be writing a position paper with some case histories and will post it on the Internet.

According to the Conference of the American College of Physicians, ‘We are talking about a plague of neurological diseases caused by this deadly poison”.

Dr. Roberts realized what was happening when aspartame was first marketed. He said “his diabetic patients presented memory loss, confusion, and severe vision loss”. At the Conference of the American College of Physicians, doctors admitted that they did not know. They had wondered why seizures were rampant (the phenylalanine in aspartame breaks down the seizure threshold and depletes serotonin, which causes manic depression, panic attacks, rage and violence).

Just before the Conference, I received a FAX from Norway, asking for a possible antidote for this poison because they are experiencing so many problems in their country. This poison is now available in 90 PLUS countries worldwide. Fortunately, we had speakers and ambassadors at the Conference from different nations who have pledged their help. We ask that you help too. Print this article out and warn everyone you know. Take anything that contains aspartame back to the store. Take the “NO ASPARTAME TEST” and send us your case history.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\45.txt
"Putin arrives in Serbia to honour leader and reinforce relations
Vladimir Putin has arrived in Belgradeto bestow a top state honour on the Serbian leader Aleksandar Vučić, hoping to shore up one of the few strong bilateral relationships Russia has in Europe and reinforce Moscow’s claims to maintaining influence in the Balkans.

Putin is popular in Serbia, where Russian opposition to the Nato bombing of the country in 1999 and the subsequent independence of Kosovo is still recalled fondly.

Vučić, a former nationalist firebrand who now styles himself as a westerniser, has played a delicate balancing act in recent years, courting Europe while attempting to maintain good relations with Moscow.

Putin, in interviews with Serbian media on the eve of his visit, lashed out at the west for trying to push Russian influence out of the Balkans. “The policy of the United States and some other western nations aimed at asserting their dominant role remains a serious destabilising factor here,” he said.

His presidential plane was escorted over Serbian airspace by MiG-29 fighter jets he recently donated to Serbia.

Western nations have expressed unease at what they believe to be Russian meddling in the region, including an apparent coup attempt in Montenegro, attempts at destabilisation in Bosnia and a humanitarian centre in southern Serbia that some western intelligence agencies believe has been a front for spying.

Putin claimed the EU was forcing Serbia to make an “artificial choice” between Moscow and the west. He complained about the expansion of Nato into the Balkans, with Montenegro joining the military alliance in 2017 after a knife-edge referendum, and Macedonia now closer to joining after recently ratifying an agreement to change its name to North Macedonia and end a long-running dispute with Greece.

Vučić, in an interview with the Guardian in Belgrade last year, insisted that Serbia’s priority was further integration with the EU, but said he wanted to keep warm relations with Putin.

“We are militarily neutral, we have no aspirations to join either Nato or the Russian alliance,” he said. “Whenever I was having a press conference with Putin I was saying I was on an EU path. We have a good relationship with Russia and we have no problems with Russia but we are on our EU path.”

In a ceremony, Putin will present Vučić with the Order of Alexander Nevsky, which in the past has been awarded to the autocratic leaders of Kremlin-friendly, post-Soviet countries.

The Russian president will then meet one-on-one with Vučić as well as having a broader meeting with regional politicians including Milorad Dodik, one of the members of Bosnia’s tripartite presidency and the former president of Republika Srpska, the Serb-dominated part of Bosnia. He has courted Russian support and spoken openly of his desire for Republika Srpska to secede from Bosnia and join Serbia. Also present, according to local media reports, will be two Montenegrin politicians who have been accused by their country’s authorities of having links to the alleged Russian-backed coup attempt.

Much of the agenda for Vučić and Putin will revolve around an EU-brokered settlement between Serbia and Kosovo, possibly involving an exchange of territories, that Vučić has been attempting to sign with his Kosovo counterpart, Hashim Thaçi. Both leaders are keen to sign a deal despite widespread opposition among their populations, and an unease about redrawing borders among much of the international community.

The deal is likely to involve Serbia acknowledging Kosovo’s independence without formally recognising it, and would pave the way for Kosovo to join the UN and for both countries to join the EU. However, Russian support is crucial, given its veto on the UN security council, and Putin may not support a deal that puts Serbia further on the path to EU integration.

Putin’s visit comes amid large-scale protests against Vučić in Belgrade. On Wednesday evening, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Belgrade for the latest instalment of the protests, which began in early December. The marches have decried lack of rule of law and media freedom under Vučić’s government, though Wednesday’s protest was specifically linked to the first anniversary of the murder of Oliver Ivanović, a Serbian politician in northern Kosovo.

There were suggestions that the Serbian government was organising pro-Putin rallies in Belgrade on Thursday in an attempt to show it could also mobilise supporters, with the newspaper Jużne Vesti claiming that government workers in the southern city of Niš were being bussed into the capital to attend rallies.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\25.txt

"It's All About The Ka$h! Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Refuse Charity Donation To Settle Lawsuit With YouTube Founder Over Engagement Video

It's all about the kash with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West!

The engaged couple are locked in a nasty legal battle with YouTube founder Chad Hurley and RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that they're gunning for a huge settlement FOR THEMSELVES and have turned down his offer to donate a sizeable sum to a charity.

The Yeezus rapper and his sex tape star fiancée sued Hurley over claims that his leaked video of their over-the-top engagement threatened their bottom line, and apparently they're not considering settling for anything less than a direct personal payment.

""Chad wanted to make a donation to a charity just to make it go away,"" a source close to the situation exclusively tells Radar

""But Kim and Kanye didn't want the money to go to a charity, they want it to go directly to them.""

Kimye aired the footage of the engagement on Keeping Up With the Kardashians in a two part special, but they are insisting that Hurley's releasing of the video hit them in the wallet.

He will face off with the power couple in court on November 17, Judge Ruth Kwan ruled on Friday, unless they can reach a settlement before then.

Given Kardashian and West's aggressive stance so far, however, that seems unlikely.

On March 14, Kardashian and West filed a motion to quash Hurley's attempt to have the case dismissed under California's anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that they ""generally object to the entirety"" of Hurley's argument and the judge ruled in their favor.

"Fox News Classified Satire By FCC
There has been an ongoing dispute about the legitimacy of the content put out by Fox News. Between the amount of complaints and discredited stories by varying myth-busting sources, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has now reclassified Fox News from a valid news source to that of satire.

The FCC cannot classify Fox News as purely entertainment-based fiction because their stories contain the names, places and actions of legitimacy. This decision to classify Fox News as satire did not come easily, because many see the news network as well-founded and they should have the freedom of speech to report as they so choose.

A statement put out by the FCC says, “The decision to classify Fox News as satire has come after several years of evaluation regarding the sources of their reporting and the bias of their programming. While much of their content is based on legitimate news, it is spun is a way that cannot not be deemed newsworthy to the viewing public. If Fox News so chooses to report actual news stories of legitimacy without skewing the content we may overturn our decision and reclassify the network to a valid news source once again.”

It seems the FCC is leaving the decision to be an actual news source up to the programming directors and others in charge at News Corp. Both Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes have not been able to be reached for comment.

As far as programming, it will be business as usual, but there will now be a running disclaimer along the bottom of the viewing screen that states, “This is not a valid news source.”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\18.txt

"Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' Expires

Now here’s something to really jump up and down on the couch for.

Hollywood’s worst-kept romantic secret—the relationship between Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes—is finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in Malibu on Labor Day, wearing matching fedoras no less.

They have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together.

Indeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction.

The absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site RadarOnline.

In September last year, Radar claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from Top Gun star Cruise, Holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage.

“Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce,” the source claimed.

“She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the insider told Radar. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”

Cruise and Holmes agreed to a divorce settlement in just 10 days, with the pact reportedly stipulating Suri would not have any contact with Cruise’s religion, Scientology.

However, had Holmes broken the rules about “embarrassing” Cruise, she could have lost the money, the source alleged.

If true, that five-year period would have ended in June—which may explain why the couple has now come out.

Remarkably, most observers believe Foxx and Holmes have been together since 2013—about a year after her split from Tom Cruise—when they were photographed dancing together at a charity bash in The Hamptons.

But they have largely avoided being photographed together and consistently denied they are a couple since then.

There have been a few slips; for example, Katie was seen with a ring on her finger in March 2016, but Foxx’s rep said it wasn’t from him.

It was claimed the two met at each other’s homes and that Katie sometimes disguised herself with wigs and hats to meet up with Foxx without being noticed.

In March 2015, a photo surfaced showing the two stars sitting in a recording studio holding hands.

Jamie is seen reclining in his chair, holding Katie’s hand and gazing at her, with his legs subtly intertwining hers. The actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of Jamie’s, while his other foot sneaks around her calf.

Foxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were “just friends.”

In December 2015, Holmes was a guest at Jamie’s surprise birthday party in New York at La Bilboquet restaurant.

And soon after, she was spotted at The Honor Bar in Beverly Hills with the actor’s youngest daughter, Annalise.

In June 2016, there seemed to be the first public confirmation that Foxx and Holmes were, indeed, in a relationship when former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan, a friend, said they were dating.

“He is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy,” Claudia said during an interview for the Allegedly podcast.

However, Jordan quickly retracted, telling Entertainment Tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had “no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.”

“I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her,” she said.

In April this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in New York, and in May they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. They were photographed leaving the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel separately.

To make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled “in cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,” Us Weekly reported in April.

The couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of Tom Cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\138fake.txt

GLENDALE,Feb 18, 2014
 
Nestlé USA Has issued a voluntary recall of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese in three different pack sizes and HOT POCKETS® brand Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese, in the two pack box
Friday, February 14, 2014 – Nestlé USA’s Prepared Foods Division today announced the voluntary recall of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese in three different pack sizes and HOT POCKETS® brand Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese, in the two pack box.  

The voluntary recall is limited to these two products, which were distributed nationwide. No other batches, sizes, including multi-packs, or varieties of HOT POCKETS® brand products are affected by this recall. The reason is due to the recall announced last week by Rancho Feeding Corporation which affects many companies.  Our teams at Nestlé have reviewed our vendor records and have determined that one Nestlé brand has been impacted by the Rancho meat recall.
While Nestlé did not purchase meat directly from Rancho, our procurement teams worked with our supply chain to understand whether any company in this chain may have purchased meat from Rancho Feeding at any time during 2013, the period of time covered by the Rancho Feeding recall.

From this review, we have confirmed that a small quantity of meat from Rancho was used at Nestlé’s Chatsworth, California production operation, a facility devoted entirely to HOT POCKETS® brand sandwiches.  The affected batches of the two varieties in our range of HOT POCKETS® brand sandwiches are being removed from the marketplace.

Consumers who may have purchased the affected batches of HOT POCKETS® brand Philly Steak and Cheese should not consume the product, but instead should return it to the place of purchase for a full refund or contact Nestlé Consumer Services at (800) 392-4057.

Rocco Ritchie, 15, does not want to go, and while on tour with Madonna, he ran off to live with his father.

According to the Inquisitr, Madonna says that Guy Ritchie is trash-talking her to Rocco, but Rocco insists that his mother is controlling and uses him as a trophy. Also, rather than being in school in New York, he is dragged along on her tour and put to work. He has had enough and wants to live with his father. This is a struggle that many divorced parents face, but Madonna feels that she is above this and went right to a judge, but Rocco is refusing to come back to the U.S.

Radar Online is reporting that Madonna is taking her controlling manner to a new level by trying to get Rocco into military school.

""Madonna is a very good mother, but she's mega controlling,"" a source close to the pop icon, 57, told Radar. ""She actively tells him what he can and can't do, who he can and can't talk to.""

But Madonna thinks that military school will straighten Rocco out, but Rocco wants a normal life with Guy Ritchie in the U.K.

""He's not being dragged around like a dancing puppet [when he's in London],"" a source told the publication. ""He can meet his friends, eat fast food, he doesn't have an early curfew. The story is his father manipulated him, which couldn't be farther from the truth. Rocco has a life and friends [in the U.K.] and he can have girlfriends and be in one place.""

The judge had ruled that Rocco should be back by Christmas but is now insisting that he is back before school starts in January

The New York Daily News has mentioned that Madonna is a meddling mama, and Rocco is over it. A source says that life in London is easier for Rocco at this point in his life.

Madonna thinks she can provide a better life for Rocco, and that Guy Ritchie's life is boring.

""(Madonna) is impossible to work with and impossible to live with for a 15-year-old boy. He has no freedom under her. She tells him he's going away to school,"" says the source. ""His life (in London) is not strict, he's not Madonna's son, he's more like a regular teen. Guy lives a very normal life, Rocco is not on movie sets, if he doesn't want to be there.""

Rocco desperately wants to enroll in school in London and come back to New York in the future to visit. Over the weekend, Rocco was seen skateboarding around the Ritchie neighborhood and simply hanging out with friends.

There is no indication whether Rocco plans to return to New York for a hearing with the judge or if he will fight it from London with his father.

Do you think it would be best if Madonna would just give Rocco time with his father?",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\064fake.txt
"Kirsten Dunst suddenly breaks down in tears at Cannes Film Festival

She gained global recognition for her role in Interview With The Vampire at the tender age of 12, so she is no stranger to commanding attention on the red carpet.

But new shots have emerged of Kirsten Dunst suddenly breaking down in tears as she attended The Beguiled premiere during the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival in the South of France on Wednesday.

Making a dramatic red carpet appearance, the accomplished  actress, 35, was seen crying as she stepped out in a fairytale plunging ballgown to promote the film.

In unexpected scenes, Kirsten found herself overwhelmed with emotion, catching the attention of onlookers as she wiped away the tears.

Quick to join her were co-star Elle Fanning, dressed in strapless lilac gown, and the director of the film Sofia Coppola, dressed in a black padded jacket.

The smiling reaction from the duo suggested the Golden Globe nominee was tears of happiness.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Kirsten Dunst for comment.

In spite of it being an emotional night, Kirsten looked beautiful in a full-length prom queen-style gown.

The Virgin Suicides starlet pinned her golden locks back, letting only a few wisps fall forward to frame her face.

But Kirsten's stunning appearance was not marred by her tears as her slick of scarlet lipstick and eyeliner remained perfectly in place.

Touched by the night's emotions, she clasped her hand to her chest as she appeared to confide in her co-star Colin Farrell.

The actress did not publicly share the reason to why she suddenly burst into tears.

Later she was seen laughing and smiling with pals after an unexpectedly eventful red carpet appearance.

Kirsten was promoting her movie, The Beguiled, which tells the story of an injured solider who seeks shelter in an all girls' boarding school.

As the drama unfolds and the serviceman (Colin Farrell) tries to win the hearts of the women who nurse him.

Dangerous rivalries begin to form between the women (played by Kirsten, Elle Fanning and Nicole Kidman) as a result of sexual temptation.

During filming for a previous movie, the director had asked Kirsten to lose weight but she had refused.

Recalling the incident, she told Variety: 'I’m eating fried chicken and McDonald’s before work. So I’m like, 'We have no options!

'I’m sorry I can’t lose weight for this role.''

"Tyga To Reveal The Ugly Truth About Kylie Jenner And Kardashians In New Tell-All Book, Insiders Say

Tyga and Kylie Jenner have made it to Splitsville, according to E! News, and it looks like things could get pretty ugly in the near future. Although the relationship is reportedly over, it doesn't look like the two have ended on amicable terms, and things are only beginning to heat up. According to Perez Hilton, Tyga is reportedly planning to release a tell-all book in the wake of his big break-up with Kylie. Insiders close to the ""Make It Nasty"" rapper have dropped a few details about the rumored upcoming book.

But how would the Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch, Kris Jenner, feel about Tyga releasing a shocking tell-all book about Kylie and the Kardashian family? In most cases, close friends of the Kardashian family are locked into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit them from speaking publicly about the family. But apparently, Tyga never signed any form of agreement which would allow him to speak publicly if he desires. A family insider recently shared details about the alleged book.

Although Tyga and Kylie Jenner initially tried desperately to conceal their relationship because of Kylie's age, it's no secret he's been in her life for quite some time. Because of that, he's also seen a lot, including how she's evolved over the years. It's quite obvious Kylie's had a number of cosmetic surgeries, but now Tyga reportedly plans to reveal just how many enhancements she's actually had. The insider even insists Tyga was there for many of the surgeries she had.

However, that's not all. The insider also claims Tyga has a staggering amount of incriminating details about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for his tell-all book. Since Tyga and Kanye have collaborated on records, he's spent lots of time with the Yeezus rapper and his famous wife. But apparently, all of his interactions with the couple haven't been pleasant. In fact, the insider claims Tyga has enough dirt on the couple to write more than one book. For months now, several rumors have circulated about the famous couple's marital problems, but of course, the rumors have not been confirmed.

Reports about Tyga's tell-all book come shortly after their epic break-up on the rapper's 26th birthday. According to People magazine, Kylie Jenner is absolutely furious about her ex-boyfriend's alleged cheating. An insider close to the 18-year-old reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heart-wrenching breakup.

Although the Kardashian women have a history of on-again, off-again relationships, it looks like this may definitely be the end for Tyga and Kylie Jenner.

"Why OYO Sharing Check-In Details With The Govt Should Worry You

By Gopal Sathe, Rachna Khaira
BENGALURU, Karnataka—Imagine this scenario: You arrive at a hotel, show your ID and check in. By the time you reach your room, the local police would have not only learnt of your arrival, they would also have access to the data you share with the hotel.

Worried? You should be. A large digital database that tracks people’s movements would be very easy to misuse, let along raise larger questions of living in a Big Brother state. But this is the crux of a new programme launched this week by OYO Rooms, which is first rolling it out in West Bengal, before expanding to other parts of the country.

The move raises concerns about data misuse and privacy infringement, especially in a country where attacks on marginalised groups are all too common. 

OYO Rooms, which claims to be India’s largest hotel network across 230 cities, with over 8,500 hotels, has grown in the past few years to become a familiar name in a country where more people are now travelling than ever for work or leisure.

On Tuesday, at the Bengal Tourism Summit in Kolkata, the company announced its new digital arrival and departure register, which would provide the government real-time data about people checking in and out of its hotels.

“The West Bengal Government has been extremely progressive and forward-thinking in its ideation and implementation of tourism-friendly schemes and initiatives,” Aditya Ghosh, CEO, India and South Asia, OYO Hotels and Homes, said at the summit. The digital register, said Ghosh, is part of this effort. “OYO will be happy to assist the WB Government to maintain a real time digital data repository,” he said.

This is not happening just in West Bengal either.

“At this point, we have seen acceptance from the state governments of Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana of our proposed digitisation of guest entry and departure records,” Ghosh said.

“The Digital arrival and departure register aims to provide a real-time update to the respective governments on who’s checking in and checking out, making this a more efficient and transparent process as compared to the manual version.”
A source close to the company explained that all hotels, whether small unbranded hotels, or five-star ones, must collect customer data and provide it to authorities whenever asked. They claimed that since the government was directly handling the data, there is no concern about any misuse from OYO’s side. This person added that the data is shared with the same authorities that would have received the physical registers, and not a wider audience.
How this can enable surveillance

The news has raised concerns amongst researchers and groups working on privacy in India. The Internet Freedom Foundation, which works on areas such as net neutrality, privacy and innovation in India, wrote, “Everyday we lose more of our privacy. This means a live update the next time you check into a hotel room. Without a warrant or a legal request, instantaneous. Scalable, deeper, richer, and in real time.”

In the absence of any reasonable privacy laws in India, broad-scale data sharing like this naturally raises concerns. Pranesh Prakash, a Fellow at the Center for Internet and Society in Bengaluru, agreed that the lack of transparency or regulations on how this data is used, or misused, is a problem. He added: “As it stands, the police don’t know what to do with all the hotel guest data they collect. Now they’re going to get even more.”

    Invasions of privacy enabled by technology could put every other human right at risk, and on a scale that would be truly terrifying.

Although the police has always had access to this data, it has not been at this scale. Each time, it would be accessing physical records one at a time as required, which automatically puts limits on how the data can be used. Digital records can enable easily searchable databases and with more data coming in, new uses can also be developed.

As Andrew Thompson, Adjunct Assistant Professor Political Science, and Fellow at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, University of Waterloo, noted in The Conversation, the right to privacy has become a pressing human rights issue. And rightly so. Big data—combined with artificial intelligence and facial recognition software—has the capacity to intrude on people’s lives in unprecedented ways, and sometimes on a massive scale.

States of all stripes are collecting data on their citizens, and have been doing so for some time. This is not going to end anytime soon. Quite the opposite, in fact. If left unchecked, invasions of privacy enabled by technology could put every other human right at risk, and on a scale that would be truly terrifying, Thompson noted.

As of now, this data is confined to just a few states—however, if shared at the national level, it would open up even larger scale use of databases to surveil the people.
For this reason, police access to such data is getting restricted in other countries. For example, in the US, police inspections used to be allowed without any limit on the number of queries, or other restrictions. However, a US Supreme Court decision in 2016 has changed this. In the case of City of Los Angeles v. Patel, the court recognised that a hotel has a privacy interest in the information it collects from its guests. The court said that hotel owners ahould be allowed to have a neutral decision-maker review an officer’s demand before handing over guest data.
Highly valuable data is more at risk

Aside from the question of misuse of data, there is also the question data theft. People staying at hotels have money to spend, and the hotel register contains a large degree of information about the individuals. As we know by now, data like this is quite valuable in itself—in fact, one of the reasons why the privatisation of IRCTC has been delayed is because the government realised it needed to arrive at a valuation for the treasure trove of data that the booking platform had gathered.

The data from hotels is a tempting target for these reasons, and recent events have shown that this is indeed the case.

Late last year, a case came to light of a hack at the Marriott, which exposed the passport numbers of more than 5 million people, dating back to records from 2014. In total, some 383 million records were compromised, including 8.6 million debit and credit card numbers. Some experts believe that the breach may have been the result of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort, according to a December report by the New York Times.

Digital repositories of check-in information will make data of this kind a tempting target for hackers, spread across multiple state government databases. Having multiple facets to attack will make it easier to find weaknesses and get to the data, obviously, but aside from that, there is also the question of how secure this data actually will be.
As noted by others, including those in the government, the volume of attacks on Indian sites isn’t the main challenge—rather, it’s the lack of seriousness about security. Add to this the unfortunate tendency of the government to go into denial about hacks. Coupled with a lack of trained cybersecurity professionals, and the refusal to launch bug bounty programmes to encourage ethical hackers to test the security of government systems, the result is that these vast databases can’t truly be considered secure.
Nothing new, but still a cause for concern

As per Government of India regulations, it is mandatory for all guests to show an ID proof at the time of check-in, explained TD Reddy, manager of the Iris Hotel in Bengaluru’s HSR Layout. “It has to be a government ID proof, with address and photo on it. So we can take the licence, voter ID, passport, Aadhaar… We just keep a photocopy. There is also a form, which includes details like your address, which city you have come from, what your contact number is, those types of details.”

So far, all hotels in India use a manual register with 20+ fields to record all relevant details of guests checking in and checking out of the hotel. This is later shared by hotels with the police authorities as mandated by law. In some places, a person familiar with the rules added, the registers need to be certified by the police before being put to use.

Collecting this information is mandated by the government, but actually passing it on is another matter. It is normally maintained as a physical record, but almost never actually collected, Reddy said.

“Sometimes if there is a missing person, or something like that, then the police can ask for details but that is all.” The police simply have to request the information for an investigation, and the hotel will look up the details, he said.

The exception is foreigners, whose details the hotels are mandated to furnish to the police. “As per MHA directions, hotels have to only share information of foreign nationals. We are not a surveillance state and hence do not seek information of Indian citizens,” said Dinkar Gupta, DGP intelligence, Punjab. This, however, appears to be changing.
OYO has created a new application which will be used by hotels to capture this information, rather than relying on paper documents. The hotel manager can record the information directly into the app, along with photos of the guests and government ID proofs. And, the company confirmed, it does not hold any of the user data—this goes directly to the government servers, which has already been tested in Jaipur, and pilots are also running in Haryana and Telangana.

The data collected by the hotels under is supposed to be accessible by the police, but it’s not supposed to be presented as a firehose of information. This automatic uploading of information can have unintended consequences, as DGP Gupta’s response highlights.

However, OYO and the governments seem to be too focused on efficiency and the ‘pioneer’ tage to recognise this.

“Technology is deeply embedded in our DNA. We are always working towards building innovative solutions for providing a smooth and hassle-free experience for our guests and hoteliers,” an OYO spokesperson said. “With the Digital Departure and Arrival Register, we aim to add a stronger data security net to the entire booking process by ensuring transparency, digitization and improved efficiency of operations for the hotels. We are proud to offer this solution which has been pioneered by us to simply and safely transfer guest information to the relevant authorities, whenever requested for any investigation, basis an information order.”

Businesses have never been at the forefront in fighting against unjust demands by governments, but OYO’s easy capitulation in handing over customer data, without even being asked for it, points to larger battles looming for privacy advocates.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\19.txt

"'Girl' Fight! Kanye West Confronts Anna Wintour Over Putting Lena Dunham On 'Vogue' Cover Instead Of Fiancée Kim Kardashian

Too big for your designed sneakers, Kanye? During a recent power lunch at the Beverly Hills Polo Lounge, the hip hop star demanded answers from Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour to the question: Why did she judge Girls star Lena Dunham as being cover worthy for the famed fashion bible, while his fiance, Kim Kardashian, has long been overlooked?

Kanye, 36, insisted to the British-born fashion icon that Kim is ""just as talented as Lena, if not more so,"" one source revealed to Radar.

""Kanye thinks that Kim has a much bigger fan base and appeal than Lena,"" said the insider.

""To Kanye, it's insulting that his friend Anna is still refusing to even consider putting Kim on the cover of Vogue. He thinks Anna is listening to a bunch of 'know-nothing' corporate haters, as he put it. He's upset that Anna isn't willing to do him this personal favor and put Kim on the cover.

""Kanye knows that it's always been a huge dream of Kim's to be on the Vogue cover and Kanye wants to make it comes true. If nothing else, Kanye is persistent.""

During an interview with Ryan Seacrest last year, Kanye declared: ""There is no way Kim Kardashian shouldn't be on the cover of Vogue. She is the most intriguing woman right now. She has got Barbara Walters calling her like everyday.""

The father-of-one may still has some work to do, however.

Last May, in a fashion slap heard around the world, Vogue editors cropped Kim out of its ""Best Dressed"" gallery when she appeared with West on the Met Ball red carpet in Manhattan, wearing the now infamous and universally panned floral print ensemble.

What's more, during Kanye's recent concert tour stop in Brooklyn, Wintour chose not to sit next to the E! starlet, despite being in the same VIP box.

""Anna is no fan of Kim or any reality star appearing in the pages of the magazine,"" one spy previously told Radar.

There is one consolation for the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star: Wintour is ""open to the idea"" of having Kardashian, 33, appear on the cover of the French or Italian edition of the magazine, a source confirmed.

""She hopes that will get Kanye off of her back,"" said the insider.

"ROSIE O FLEES CRAZY ""HOUSEWIVES"" NEIGHBORS

Run ROSIE RUN – right back onto ""The View""! WHY?!

""THE Real Housewives of Miami"" may be fun to watch on TV, but one of the couples on the Bravo reality show drove Rosie O'Donnell right out of her ritzy neighborhood!

The outspoken comedian couldn't stand living near Lisa Hochstein and her plastic surgeon husband Dr. Lenny ""Boob God"" Hochstein on exclusive Star Island, so she sold her home of 18 years for a whopping $16.5 million.

""It was getting a little CRAZY with all those tour boats and that Miami Show...The Beverly...The Mom of Miami, whatever it is, Housewives,"" Rosie told a radio interviewer.

An insider added: ""Rosie thinks the Hochsteins are crass and totally classless, and all the nosy fans and camera crews that come with being a 'Housewife' were driving her nuts.

""She loved Star Island and many of her neighbors. She really thought she would grow old there. But because of Lisa and her husband, she decided to sell her home.""

Things hit rock bottom for Rosie last October with the heavy media coverage of the Hochsteins' Halloween party – which featured a black Jesus bound to a crucifix, a bloody zombie giving ""birth"" to a stillborn baby, and other creepy and bloody displays.

About that time, mother-of-five Rosie was contacted by a real estate agent who asked if she was interested in putting her mansion up for sale, and the en­tertainer gave a resounding yes.

The former talk-show host, who married executive-search consultant Michelle Rounds in 2012 and adopted a baby girl with her, reportedly bought a $5 million home in the far sleepier Sarasota, Fla., area.

""Rosie thought about organizing the community to pressure the neighbors from hell to move,"" said the source. ""But with a new wife and baby, she decided to take the high road and simply find a new home.""

"Justin Bieber pokes fun at himself after stepping out with an wet mark

Accidents happen, but this star is not sorry about it.

Justin Bieber happily made a joke at his own expense after stepping out with a big wet patch on his pants the day before.

The 23-year-old shared an Instagram of himself and Adam Sandler's character Billy Madison on Thursday to 'fess' up to peeing in his pants.

Just a few hours after pictures of the star surfaced of him with an unfortunate stain on his crotch area, Justin posted a picture of himself next to a screen grab from the movie Billy Madison.

Using a quote from a scene in the 1995 movie, Justin captioned the side-by-side image: 'You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.'

In the popular comedy, Adam's character - an adult man force to return to school to prove he can run his father's business - pretends to pee his pants so that one of his school friends does not get made fun of for actually peeing his pants.

The pee or not pee drama all started after the 24-year-old was seen in West Hollywood, California, with a giant wet patch on the front of his sweats.

The Sorry star's stain covered his entire crotch area and was rather visible in his almost $700 grey Vetements sweatpants.

The star ignored both the wet patch and a cameraman who constantly asked him about his ex Selena Gomez's new relationship with The Weeknd.

Justin made a beeline for his matte black Range Rover which he has had the badge changed on so it says Stealth Rover.

While in too much of a hurry to check his crotch area, Justin was not in too much of a hurry to grab a healthy juice.

Obviously unperturbed by walking around in wet pants, the platinum blond singer then headed to Earthbar.

There he fueled up on a green juice and walked along one of the area's busiest streets without a wet patch care in the world.

Aside from his stained designer sweatpants, Justin wore a white T-shirt with a distressed grey jean jacket and a pair of Nike Air Huarache.

As is his style these days, the Baby hitmaker added a pair of clear lens glasses.

Justin did ditch his stained pants later to head to church late that night.

It was fortunate he opted for jeans, as rumored on and off again love interest Kourtney Kardashian was also there.

There was also no missing Kourt with the 37-year-old wearing a sheer bra-flashing top to the religious service.

Kourtney and the much younger pop star have been linked since 2015 but neither have confirmed if they are romantic or just good friends.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\024fake.txt

The media mogul denies shelling out big bucks on an apartment for the actress, but insiders say the posh pad is for real - and LiLo is taking advantage of it!

"Kate Middleton Desperate To Save Prince William Marriage: Can't Let Go Of Pampered Royal Lifestyle | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Kate Middleton might be angry with her husband Prince William for embarrassing their family with his bizarre dancing and drinking during his ski trip, and all of the cheating rumors, but that doesn’t mean she’ll be divorcing him anytime soon. In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tried to convince everyone that they are still madly in love during their trip to Paris this weekend.

Prince William and Kate Middleton rekindled their shared love of art during a visit to the Musee D’Orsay in Paris. The Duke and Duchess first fell in love while studying art history at St Andrew’s University in Scotland nearly two decades ago.

Eyewitnesses say that art enthusiast Kate Middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with William by her side. Kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour. Insiders say that Prince William, meanwhile, looked tired and tense.

Judging from the photos that were snapped, there is some major tension between the Royal couple right now.  Kate looked absolutely miserable!

There’s a possibility that Kate Middleton is worried that if she does divorce Prince William, she won’t have the same privileged lifestyle that she has now. It’s no secret that the Duchess of Cambridge makes headlines simply because she’s Prince William’s wife. But, if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage, Kate’s life won’t be the same.

She won’t be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances. And, that’s probably what she’ll miss the most. Kate Middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family, she won’t be in it anymore.

Plus, royal observers know that if Kate Middleton forgives Prince William for his antics drunken antics now, there’s a good chance that she’ll forgive him again and again. In other words, the Duchess is turning a blind eye to her husband’s behavior because she probably doesn’t have any other choice. It’s either this or she goes back to her mother Carole Middleton’s party favor business. Do you agree?

"Superman to Not Appear in ""Justice League"" Movie

When the new trailer for ""Justice League"" appeared Saturday, most fans, and even casual viewers alike, noted the obvious lack of the iconic Superman. Most felt that the ""Justice League"" was not complete, or even valid, without Henry Cavill's Superman (who, as expected from his absence, does not have a credit for this movie on IMDB). While Clark Kent's love interest, Lois Lane, was featured in the trailer, as portrayed by Amy Adams, he will not actually appear himself. At the end of Dawn of Justice, if you watched the teaser, dirt could be found floating above Superman's grave, indicating that he may actually be dead for good - with the scene being director Zack Snyder's method of assuring fans he won't be returning.   Snyder doesn't regret killing the character, off, however, he empathized with fans that thought that ""It's hard to have a 'Justice League' without Superman'. Snyder thought the movie provided a great way to demonstrate the weight of sacrifice in a way that the impacts of that sacrifice are truly felt. Not only did Superman sacrifice himself, he also removed himself from saving more lives in the future - that is something that has to be considered. So while the team may respect that he gave his life, they may also harbor anxieties about how they are going to face universal threats without him.

"Desperate To Return Home, Deported Veterans Face Exile
Hector Barajas came to the United States from Mexico when he was 7 years old and became a green card-carrying resident, meaning he could legally live and work in the U.S., but was still subject to deportation. Deciding that he wanted to give back to his adopted country, he enlisted in the Army at 18. Barajas served in the 82nd Airborne from 1995–2001 when he left the service with an honorable discharge.

After the military, Barajas made a string of bad decisions that landed him in prison for a year and a half for discharging a firearm, but because of his immigrant status, he was deported to Mexico in 2004. When he was deported, Barajas was banned from the U.S. for 20 years, a ban he broke when he illegally re-entered the country to be with his newborn daughter. He was exiled in 2010 and was once again sent back over the border to a place he didn’t grow up in and had few ties to.

And Barajas isn’t alone.

There’s also Howard Bailey, a Navy veteran of the Gulf War and father of two, who was deported to Jamaica six years ago where he struggles to make a living as a pig farmer. After serving 15 months in a state work camp for drug possession, Bailey turned his life around, but was picked up by immigration officers years later when he filed for U.S. citizenship.

Mauricio Hernandez, an Army combat veteran from the war in Afghanistan, was deported to Mexico after receiving convictions for drug possession and the possession of an illegal firearm. He works as a martial arts trainer for troubled youth in Tijuana, Mexico.

Barajas, Bailey, and Hernandez are three of the veterans that will be profiled in Mike Seely’s upcoming documentary, “Exiled: America’s Deported Veterans.” Barajas and Bailey received honorable discharges and Hernandez received a general discharge under honorable conditions. All three were legal green card holders, but were deported for committing a crime. Their deportation occurred after they’d already paid their dues to society, sometimes in the form of jail time or a prison sentence, Seely told Task & Purpose.

When veterans are deported, many return to countries they haven’t seen since they were children. They often have few familial ties there and little support. Seely said he didn't realize that veterans could even be deported, adding that he became aware of the issue when his wife returned from a vacation in Tijuana, Mexico, with a pamphlet given to her by a deported U.S. veteran.

When deported veterans are forced to leave their families, as both Bailey and Barajas were forced to do, their lives are completely disrupted. In addition, veterans who are receiving treatment from the Department of Veteran Affairs for service-connected disabilities find themselves suddenly cut off, which means that in addition to facing cultural and financial barriers, some may face significant health challenges, Seely explained.

While military service can be a fast track for citizenship, it is not guaranteed. In addition, a military veteran still needs to apply to be a citizen, said Seely, adding that many of the veterans he spoke with never got around to filing for citizenship, were uninformed of the process, or chose not to because they were legal residents.

Seely said that he’s focusing on deported veterans because he doesn’t feel that the punishment fits the crime.

“I think it’s a slap in the face to a veteran to deport them,” said Seely. “Even if they have committed a crime. If you’re willing to put your life on the line for your country that says a lot and they should be afforded that respect.”

Immigrant veterans face deportation because they’ve violated immigration laws, however, it shouldn’t be an extension of criminal punishment, said Seely.

“Especially after these guys have served their time for things they’ve done.”

Alisa Wellek is the executive director for the Immigrant Defense Project where she has worked for eight years helping those facing deportation by ensuring they have access to proper legal representation.

Welleck has been working with Bailey to try to overturn his deportation ruling for the last two years. It wasn’t always the case that people were subject to mandatory detention and deportation, Welleck told Task & Purpose.

In 1996, the laws changed to include something called aggravated felonies, which can result in immediate deportation. Welleck explained that “a crime doesn’t have to be aggravated or a felony” to be considered an aggravated felony and can include minor offenses like drug possession. Additionally, in aggravated felony cases, judges have little discretion to weigh the merits of a veteran’s service.

It’s unclear how many U.S. veterans have been deported since the law was changed in 1996 — the government doesn’t track those statistics, explained Gillian Christensen, a press secretary for U.S. Customs Immigration Enforcement in an email to Task & Purpose. What is clear is the significant toll it takes on individual veterans who have been deported.

“It upsets me that our government is doing these kinds of things,” said 38-year-old Barajas in a phone interview with Task & Purpose. “These politicians will easily send you to another war, or draft these guys, but they won’t step up to the plate and support the troops like everybody talks about.”

After he was permanently deported, Barajas struggled with homelessness and substance abuse before getting a second start when he founded the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana, Mexico, in October 2012. The support house, dubbed The Bunker, offers room and board to deported veterans, free of charge and has housed 20 veterans since it was founded. There are currently two veterans staying at the house and Barajas is in contact with more than 100 military veterans from more than 30 countries.

“If you come to the bunker you’re going to see there’s more than 30 American flags,” said Barajas. “We’re as American as apple pie, just different cultures.”

However, he still holds out hope even though he faces a lifetime ban from the country he served and where his daughter lives, growing up without him.

“One of the things I like about the United States, is if there’s something that needs to be changed and it's a worthy cause, it’ll happen, said Barajas. “A piece of paper shouldn’t define whether or not you're an American. It’s what you believe.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\11.txt

"Back Channel to Trump: Loyal Aide in Trump Tower Acts as Gatekeeper

"Muhammad Ali was deathly afraid of flying. Louisville just named its airport after him.
Muhammad Ali was deathly afraid of flying. Louisville just named its airport after him.
On an hour-long flight from Louisville to Chicago in the late ’50s, Cassius Clay prayed he wasn’t going to die.

The teenage Clay, then a dominant amateur boxer, said he hadn’t developed his phobia of flying, one also held by his father, until that fateful flight on a twin-engine jet. “Many times I’ve searched my mind to find where the fear originated,” he said in his 1975 autobiography. Clay recalled how the plane on the flight to Chicago experienced so much turbulence during a storm that “some of the seats were torn from their bolts on the floor.”

“I really thought it was our last ride,” remembered Joe Martin, Clay’s coach, according to Jonathan Eig’s “Ali: A Life.” “And I mean Cassius was praying and hollering! Oh, man, he was scared to death.”

That fear stayed with Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, for most of his transcendent career. So what would Ali, who died in 2016 at 74, say to Wednesday’s news that Louisville is naming its airport after a man who famously hated air travel? “I’m not afraid of the fight,” he told reporters before a 1961 bout. “I’m afraid of the flight.”

As the Louisville Courier-Journal reported, Mayor Greg Fischer said in a news conference that Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport would serve as a reminder that while the boxer belonged to the world, the Kentucky city was his home.

“Muhammad became one of the most well-known people to ever walk the earth and has left a legacy of humanitarianism and athleticism that has inspired billions of people,” Fischer said. “It is important that we, as a city, further champion the champ’s legacy. And the airport renaming is a wonderful next step.""

For years as a young fighter, Ali was able to avoid jets and take trains and Martin’s station wagon to his fights, according to David Remnick’s “King of the World.” But that would all change in 1960.

In May of that year, Clay had to get to San Francisco to qualify for the U.S. Olympic boxing team. If the 18-year-old ever wanted to accomplish his goal of being one of the youngest heavyweight champions in the history of boxing, he had to immediately overcome an opponent not named Floyd Patterson or Sonny Liston — one that the man who called himself “the greatest” couldn’t outbox or trash-talk.

“You’re going to have to fly, son, if you want to be a fighter, fly to places all over the world,” said his trainer, Dick Sadler, according to Ali’s autobiography, “The Greatest: My Own Story.” “It’s a strange fear. But to you it’s real. You’ve got to either overcome it or give up boxing.”

Local media called Clay’s decision to fly to San Francisco “a big one,” adding that if he didn’t take to the air for that fight, then “he might have to ride a lot of buses before he gets anywhere in professional boxing.”

Eig wrote that even though Martin persuaded Clay to fly, the flight hit turbulence over Indiana, causing the charismatic fighter to bend over and again pray for his life. “He went to an army supply store and bought a parachute and actually wore it on the plane,” said Martin’s son, Joe Martin Jr.

While Clay’s supernatural confidence in the ring showed during the Olympic qualifiers in San Francisco, it was nowhere to be found when it came to flying back to Louisville. Instead of flying home with Martin, Clay pawned a gold watch, one of his prizes, to get train fare.

But Clay and his team had an even larger problem than San Francisco: The 1960 Olympics were in Rome.

“When the team was ready to go to Rome, I told Martin I wouldn’t fly,” Ali said in his autobiography. “I’d be willing to take a boat, but the thought of flying over the ocean sent chills up and down my spine.”

Seeing that his fighter was serious, Martin, a police officer who had first offered to teach Clay how to box when he was a boy after he reported his bike had been stolen, took him to Central Park in Louisville for hours in hopes of talking him out of throwing away his chance at gold.

""I calmed him down and convinced him if he wanted to be heavyweight champion of the world, then he had to go to Rome and win the Olympics,” Martin told HBO, according to the Guardian.

He did just that, winning the gold medal as a light heavyweight. Clay pointed to another reason for his sudden courage.

“What I was afraid of most was the plane crashing, and nothing would satisfy me until I called the Air Force and asked them to give me a record of plane flights between Rome and America,” he said in his autobiography. “They said they couldn’t even remember the last time one had crashed. That calmed me down enough to take the flight to Rome.”

The fighter’s aviophobia would come up again. At 21, about a year before he became heavyweight champion for the first time, Clay was scheduled to fly back to Louisville from New York after defeating Doug Jones in March 1963. Ali suddenly grew concerned about his afternoon flight at Newark International Airport, according to Eig.

“When was the last crash?” Clay asked loudly, waiting to board the plane. “When was the last crash?” He had to be hushed by one of this traveling partners, worried that they would get tossed off the flight.

Ali’s colorful personality allowed for him to openly joke about his fear of flying in a 1970 interview with historian Jim Jacobs archived by the Boxing Hall of Fame. The interview was conducted in the lead-up to his fight with Jerry Quarry, Ali’s return to the ring after he was barred for more than three years for refusing to serve in the military during the Vietnam War. To Ali, a turbulent plane scared him much more than Quarry or Joe Frazier, the rival he would fight for the first time months later.

“The only thing [that] scares me is when I’m on a jet and the lady says, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve just been informed by the pilot that we are coming into a thunderstorm. We tried to get around it, but we can’t. It might get a little choppy, so please fasten your safety belts, and we will resume serving dinner in five minutes,'” Ali said, shaking his right hand as if it were a rocky airplane. “And when they get scared and tell you to fasten safety belts — and then I’ll see the stewardesses' eyes big and I see the lightning and the dark cloud. And all of a sudden — Bam! Plane started shaking, the wings flopping, and I think about the plane splitting and the long fall, and I say, ‘Why did I have to rush? I could have took a bus. Oh Lord, if you just let me off of here, I’ll take a train the next time.'

“Boom! The plane’s shaking and falling,” he continued. “And I say, ‘If I get off this plane, I’ll whoop any man in the world.' ”

By the ’80s, Ali had finally conquered his fear of flying, writing that the activity had become “automatic.” He’d later talk about how much he enjoyed sitting in the cockpit with the pilots, saying how he wanted to buy his own plane and helicopter. Ali got so comfortable that his safety had almost become secondary.

“Once, when a flight attendant instructed him to buckle up, Ali replied, ‘Superman don’t need no seat belt,’” Eig wrote. “To which the flight attendant answered, ‘Superman don’t need no plane!’ ”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\48.txt

""Michelle has been labeled a 'ruthless mon­ster' for bullying not only Barack, but her loyal staff,"" said an insider. ""She dishes out abuse and punish­ment for the slightest of infractions. She doesn't give a damn who she humiliates - even the presi­dent!""

The ENQUIRER has also caught the First Couple fighting over wild child Malia after the 17-year-old was recently caught at a boozy Brown University student bash. Eyewitnesses said the First Daughter was playing the popular campus drinking game called Beer Pong!

""The First Lady and the President got into a screaming match over it, each blaming the other for letting their underage daughter attend a wild drinking party,"" said a political insider.

Michelle also ignored the taxpayers when she stormed off for a trip to China with her mother and daughters - putting aside Obama's concerns over cost.

Insiders told The ENQUIRER that Michelle (seen here in France) couldn't stand to be around her husband after the president took an embarrassing ""selfie"" photo with sexy Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela's memorial service!

Things got worse for Barack after Michelle discovered a secret love nest kept by her husband! Multiple insiders confirmed to The ENQUIRER that Obama was a regular at the swanky Jefferson Hotel, located a few blocks from the White House.

"Sienna Miller on why her new role is not 'just a wife'

If there's one thing Sienna Miller has in common with the character she plays in exploration epic Lost City of Z  it's that she's not afraid to air her views  loud and clear. So much so that she altered a script when she thought Nina Fawcett was appearing as too much of a stereotypical ""wife"" - with the director framing the scrawled-on piece of paper. The film - based on a true story - is about explorer Percy Fawcett  played by Charlie Hunnam  and his quest to find a mysterious lost city in the heart of the Amazon. His first mission in 1906  accompanied by surveying partner Henry Costin (played by Robert Pattinson)  sees them return with apparent evidence that this previously undiscovered community exists.

On top of that, Anna has revealed that she’s considered a “high-risk pregnancy”, which could seriously complicate things. “I wish we didn’t have this biological clock.

"Judge tells Stein, 'Your money's no good here!' during bribe for a recount.



MADISON, Wis -- It looks as if Green Party candidate, and former stripper, Jill 'Franken' Stein knows no limits when it comes to recounting votes. According to Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn, Stein, who has been a regular legal busy body, lately, asked to approach the bench, and the motion was sustained. She went up to the judge and whispered that she had 3.5 million dollars in a briefcase in her car, directly from Hilary Clinton, adding, if they can recount the votes, then the Judge could be recounting her money. The Judge was not amused and ordered the bailiff to arrest Ms. Stein and then ruled that there would be no recount. Stein was led out of the courtroom, crying and in cuffs. Judge Bailey-Rihn then proceeded to explain to the courtroom about Pizzagate, and how she believed Hilary Clinton was a possible pedophile and a Reptilian shape shifter (citing David Ickes work, and the many Youtube videos on the subject) and would never get a recount in her jurisdiction, as long as she sat on the bench. Ms. Clinton could not be reached for comment. Baily-Rihn told us that there was most likely fraud in the election, and count, but since both sides do it, it works out to be mostly fair, in the end.

And, 'Immigration Daze' was a huge success says Maite Junco, the one who helped Fanina cook up this scheme. ""Their kids brought 'em, and we got 'em!

"Kanye West: If He's Not North's Father, Which Of Kim Kardashian's Exes Is?

OMG! We can't imagine Kanye West, 38, not being the bio dad for precious daughter North, two, but according to a new report, he's not real her father, so who is? Kim Kardashian, 35, has had several famous exes she could have turned to when she wanted to have a child, and since she froze her eggs, she may have asked one of them to become a baby daddy. Let's take a look at who the candidates could be!

According to a cover story in Star magazine, Kim froze her eggs in 2012 when she was worried about her ticking biological clock, and had an ex fertilize one before she got with Kanye. ""There'd been buzz that Kim had frozen some embryos, which she'd created with an ex-boyfriend's sperm, so she could have a baby when she was ready.""

So who could the daddy be? We know Kim always deeply loved Reggie Bush, 31, as they dated on and off for three years, from 2007 – 2010. And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North's daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.

Her most recent ex would have been Kris Humphries, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011. While their union ended on bitter terms, could she have still turned to him to help father a baby? After all, they still weren't divorced when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner Ray J, 35? Could Kim have asked him for a daddy favor?

Stream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE

Star's report claims that Kanye wasn't as eager about having kids as Kim was. ""When Kanye refused to back down, Kim may have had one of the embryos implanted,"" their source said. ""She didn't have time to wait for Kanye,"" the magazine claims.

""People are speculating that Kim tricked Kanye into believing they conceived in Italy so he wouldn't figure out the real story, that she'd already been implanted with an embryo that had another man's DNA!"" according to their story.

While neither Kim or Kanye has commented yet, this story is pretty unbelievable. North looks like an absolutely perfect genetic combination of Kim and Kanye that simply cannot be denied!

"Kathy Griffin feels ‘betrayed’ by Anderson Cooper after CNN firing

While Kathy Griffin continues her sympathy crusade after weathering a storm of criticism for her terrible Trump severed-head photo, sources say she’s seething about how Anderson Cooper dropped her from his CNN New Year’s Eve broadcast like a hot potato.

Sources said Griffin had expected CNN “golden boy” Cooper to stand by her, but the news network swiftly announced she was fired from the NYE broadcast with Cooper, which they’ve done together for 10 years.

TV insiders say respected newsman Cooper had no choice but to condemn Griffin’s disturbing photoshoot, in which she held up a faux severed and bloody head of President Trump.

After the controversial image of Griffin went viral, sparking widespread backlash, Cooper tweeted, “For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.”

But a source said, “Kathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.” Griffin appeared in a tearful press conference Friday where she sobbed of Trump: “He broke me.” No word about Cooper.

The buzz at CNN is that Cooper could use the opportunity of Griffin’s firing to bring his longtime buddy, Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live” star Andy Cohen, into his NYE broadcast. Cohen also hosts “Love Connection” on Fox.

The source said, “Anderson wants Andy to co-host with him. They are already doing a multi-city tour together, they are besties and have a great rapport.” Cohen revealed that they were set up on a blind date in the early ’90s, but Cooper says Cohen blew it during their initial phone call by being “too enthusiastic.” They were later introduced by mutual friends in LA and their platonic bromance blossomed.

But sources add that Cohen “may have some contractual problems to overcome” with Bravo before he can appear on CNN with Cooper.

"Queen Elizabeth and Kate Middleton Clash Again: Duchess Scared of Difficult Pregnancy, Adopting Second 'Royal' Baby - Reports

Kate Middleton is said to have miscarried. However, a new report claims otherwise. The new report says that it is impossible for Prince George's mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead. In fact, this is one of the things that Kate and Queen Elizabeth are arguing heatedly about.

The Aug. 11th print edition of Life & Style Magazine claims that Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth are in a serious row. This is not because Kate Middleton lost what could have been the baby sister (reportedly!) of Prince George, but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all. The assumption is that Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles' wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of Queen Elizabeth, but it seems as if Kate Middleton is rubbing the Queen the wrong way too.

Celeb Dirty Laundry reports that Kate Middleton had it with all the meddling the Queen is doing with her personal affairs, especially on how to raise Prince George and when she should get pregnant again. Even though she originally wanted a lot of kids, having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby. Even though she's not entirely closing her doors to another baby, Kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet.  Allegedly, she would rather adopt than have another one!

Because what the Queen wants, the Queen should get, Kate's attitude is making the Queen see red.  The idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the Queen to a frenzy.  Royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal family's bloodline would be considered ""a spare"" for the throne, so what Kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off. Kate knows this but she also observes that the Queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy. She is hoping against hope that the Queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home, Celeb Dirty Laundry reports.

This is not the first time that Kate Middleton's ways and ideas crossed the Queen. The Life & Style magazine's July 14 feature ""Tormented by the Queen,"" said the Queen flew into rage when she learned of Middleton's plans to move baby Prince George out of London.

Kate Middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying Prince George rather than plan another baby though. For this summer, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of Mystique. With Prince George now in tow, August will be spent a bit differently.

""The couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishments are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen's Sandringham Estate,"" shared royal family sources with Vanity Fair.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\079fake.txt

"Ben Affleck Has A New Fresh Face: BOTOX BEN

FRESHENED UP!?!? After a VERY ROUGH year, doctors say that it appears that Ben Affleck his face freshened up! The rumored help? Botox for his crow’s feet & fillers to soften the lines around his mouth.

“Ben is obsessed about growing old,” a pal tells NAUGHTY GOSSIP. “He will do whatever it takes to feel hot and young, thats is why he was hooking up with a 20-something nanny. That didn’t work out so well, and neither will all the plastic surgery.”

Affleck is rumored to have used cosmetic dentistry to help achieve his perfectly white, straight teeth. Affleck may also be using Botox injections to keep his face wrinkle-free.

"Iggy Azalea and Odell Beckham Jr.: Dating!

You might be surprised by the news that Odell Beckham Jr. and Iggy Azalea are dating, but if you stop and think about it for a moment, they actually make perfect sense as a couple.

For one thing, Odell is famous for his one-handed catch, and Iggy is a famous one-hit wonder.

Beckham is forever frustrating defensive backs with his incredible talent, while Azalea frustrates her peers by being an offensive hack with an appalling lack of talent.

The list goes on and on:

Odell is a wide receiver, and Iggy receives widespread criticism for being awful.

Beckham runs hot routes and catches passes, while Azalea received a pass for being a terrible rapper because she's hot.

You get the idea.

Anyway, according to Us Weekly, Beckham and Azalea have finally started admitting that they're a couple.

Rumors that Odell and Iggy are dating first started circulating back in May, but both parties denied they'd been hooking up.

“I literally don’t even know Odell Beckham. I don’t,” Azalea told TMZ at the time.

“He was at my friend’s party and we took a picture with a bunch of people and that’s it. I don’t know him. I’ve not even had a conversation with him.”

Shortly thereafter, however, Iggy admitted that she and Beckham were more than friends, but insisted they had ""a long way to go” to become a couple.

Now, they're finally dating openly, but reps for Azalea are still lying about the relationship for some reason:

“It’s new, very fresh,” one insider tells Us.

Apparently, we're all supposed to ignore the fact that Iggy and Odell have clearly been dating for like six months.

We can actually see why Iggy would want to keep her love life out of the headlines.

Her last relationship imploded in spectacular fashion when LA Laker Nick Young was caught cheating on Iggy after his teammate uploaded a candid video of Young confessing to infidelity.

Shortly thereafter, Iggy learned that Young, whom she was engaged to at the time, had gotten another woman pregnant.

An experience like that would make anyone want to keep their next relationship on the DL for as long as possible.

For his part, Odell was previously dating model Polyxeni Ferfeli.

Everyone has a type, and apparently, Odell's is super into chicks with ridiculous names.

We wonder is Polyxeni is also a horrendous rapper ...",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\213fake.txt
"FKA Twigs Looks Miserable With Robert Pattinson At Cannes Film Festival | Celeb Dirty Laundry

FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson are reportedly going strong. The Twilight star and his fiancée attended the 2017 Cannes Film Festival this week. The couple didn’t look as happy as they are reported to be. It’s been months since fans have seen FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson together.

They keep their relationship low-key for the most part. It’s probably because FKA Twig has to deal with the crazy Twilight fans bugging her on social media. She looked really sour when they went to the red-carpet premiere of Robert Pattinson’s latest movie Good Time.

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were glowing on the red carpet. While Robert Pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there, his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event. FKA Twigs stood beside him in a busy Dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it.

The Daily Mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening. Robert Pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo.

He was later joined by co-stars Taliah Webster and Buddy Duress, writer and co-director Ben Safdie, and co-director Joshua Safdie. Robert Pattinson reportedly got engaged to FKA Twigs back in August 2015. The couple has kept their relationship out of the public eye as much as possible. Despite stepping out together at public events, they rarely speak out about their relationship. Though FKA Twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is “100 percent worth it.”

She told The Observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet. She only attends these events to support “the man that I love.” She also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet. FKA Twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing. But, that doesn’t stop her from loving and supporting Robert Pattinson.

Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were all smiles when they celebrated his 31st birthday earlier this month in Culver City, Los Angeles. The actor beamed and even displayed PDA with FKA as they joined friends at an intimate party at Akasha restaurant. However, FKA Twigs seemed engaged with her phone every time Robert Pattinson was talking about something. The couple were later seen hugging and kissing each other outside the venue.

"Kourtney Kardashian Neglecting Her Children To Party In Cannes? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Is Kourtney Kardashian neglecting her children to party in Cannes? That’s what a lot of fans can’t help but wonder as Kris Jenner was spotted taking care of her children, Mason and Penelope Disick near her family home in Calabasas, California on Wednesday, May 24. Kris took her grandchildren to run errands with her while Kourtney was frolicking with her new boy toy Younes Bendjima.

Eyewitnesses say that Kris took Mason and Penelope along with Kim Kardashian’s daughter North West out for frozen yogurt. She’s babysitting her grandchildren while Kourtney and Scott are partying thousands of miles away in Cannes.

A lot of fans can’t help but wonder why Kourtney would still be in Cannes knowing that Scott is there with his new girlfriend Bella Thorne. Apparently, both parents are trying to compete with each other for paparazzi and media attention while their children are back at home.

Sure, Kourtney Kardashian loves her children and puts them first in her life – she’s proven it plenty of times in the past. But is her new romance with Younes Bendjima getting in the way of her parental responsibilities? That might be the case, especially since a lot of people are pointing out that both Kourtney and Scott are acting like children themselves.

Kourtney has spent the last week showing off her bikini body and making out with Younes in the South of France. Taking a page out of her book, Scott is now doing the same by partying with Bella. He was even spotted getting very up close and personal with her at their hotel pool in Cannes. Clearly, Scott is trying to make a point by cuddling and making out with the former Disney star in the same town as his ex and baby mama.

So far Kourtney has not made any comments about her new relationship with Younes Bendjima. But if there’s one thing for certain, it’s that she doesn’t plan on getting back with Scott Disick anytime soon.

That chapter is closed, done and in the past. Still, many critics can’t help but wonder if Kourtney might be flaunting her relationship with Younes to make Scott jealous. After all, Scott did it to her several times in the past.

Either way, it doesn’t look like Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick’s drama is going to end anytime soon. In the meantime, don’t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news on Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\212fake.txt

""She's had plastic surgery,"" one TV mole told the mag. ""I think she's had it before and it's all because she's unhappy about looking older – especially when compared to Portia [de Rossi]!""

And, according to another behind-the-scenes snitch, her glowing appearance isn't just TV magic.

""She had a lift and still gets Botox! She drives her hair and makeup staff nuts!"" continued the source.

A production insider revealed the challenges her glam team face when it comes to concealing scarring due to the work she's had done: ""It usually takes them about two-and-a-half hours to give Ellen that peaches-and-cream glow her fans love,"" said the source.

So just what has she had done?

Top plastic surgeons examined photos of the comedienne and say the CoverGirl spokeswoman appears to have a multitude of procedures, including face-, eye-, neck- and brow-lifts.

""There is a dramatic change that made her look somewhat different,"" leading NYC cosmetic surgeon Dr. Yoel S. Shahar, who has not treated DeGeneres, told The ENQUIRER. ""To achieve such a change she needed to have multiple procedures. It is quite obvious she underwent a full facelift that improved her neck and jawline. No injectable like Botox can create such a change.""

""She also appeared to have had a forehead lift, elevating her eyebrows significantly in addition to Botox injections eliminating the wrinkles at the crow's feet, glabella and forehead,"" Dr. Shahar continued.

And if that wasn't enough, DeGeneres' journey to find the fountain of youth allegedly didn't end there.

Dr. Shahar suggested the 56-year-old appears to have had upper and lower blepharoplasty, which ""smooth and improve the eyelid, giving her a youthful look.

""It seems obvious to me that she also had fillers under her eyes and skin care by chemical or laser peel,"" Dr. Shahar claimed. ""Overall, I believe she's undergone successful surgical and nonsurgical procedures that made her look her best.""

Famed cosmetic dermatologist Dr. Kenneth Mark, who has not treated the Emmy Award-winning TV host, added: ""She has been transformed from having a frown face with sunken cheeks under her eyes and jowls with prominent marionette lines to now looking alive and well!""

DeGeneres, who tied the knot with 41-year-old glamorous actress de Rossi in 2008, is a household name for her effortless chic, which according to the show insider is all just an act.

""She pretends not to care about her appearance to the world but in reality, she's obsessed with plastic surgery  – and a sucker for new cosmetic procedures and products,"" said the source.

"Ellen, Portia cancel appearance after 'epic' fight

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi didn't show up at a charity fund-raiser for rescued animals after having a huge fight in the car on the way to Sunday's event, sources tell Page Six.

The power couple was on the way to the Saving SPOT! fund-raiser at Tiato in Santa Monica when they got into an argument and turned around without attending the event, even though they were listed and pictured on the invitation as hosts. Ellen and Portia on Monday insisted to Page Six they had informed the charity they would be unable to make it and their picture should not have been on the invitation.

A source told us: ""Ellen and Portia were supposed to be at the event at 5 p.m., but at 6:30 p.m., the media was still waiting for their arrival. Reporters were told they were on their way, until the head of the charity informed everyone at the end of the event that they weren't going to make it due to 'logistics.'""

The source added, ""Ellen and Portia were delayed and were in the car on the way, when they had an epic fight. They ended up turning around and not going to the fund-raiser.""

Saving SPOT! is a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing dogs and providing them with caring owners. Ellen and Portia attended last year's benefit in Beverly Hills and had been happy to be listed as hosts for this year's event, we're told.

Ellen - a generous animal-welfare supporter - and Portia said in a statement to Page Six: ""We were happy to lend our names as honorary chairs and the organization was always aware that we would be unable to attend. This is the first time we have seen our images attached to the invite. It was not approved and it is misleading.""

DeGeneres' attorney Marty Singer said, ""The story is a complete lie. My client told the organizer they never agreed nor planned to attend the event. There was no fight that caused them not to attend."" The charity didn't respond to requests for comment.

Ellen recently slammed divorce rumors and reports of arguments on the season premiere of her talk show. ""I had a great summer,"" she said in September. ""I went on a trip with Portia, my beautiful wife - who I am happily married to, but thank you for your heartfelt concern, tabloids.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\078fake.txt
"Caitlyn Jenner and O.J. Simpson Are Set to Reunite on TV: ""It Would Be Fascinating!"" (EXCLUSIVE)

It’s hard to get much more sensational than this: a TV show pairing the world’s most famous transgender celebrity with the world’s most famous acquitted murder suspect — especially when both have connections to the Kardashians! Life & Style has exclusively learned that TV producers have come up with an idea to bring O.J. Simpson and his old pal Caitlyn Jenner together in a televised reunion.

The former football star, 70, who was acquitted of double homicide in 1995 and completed a nine-year prison stint on Oct. 1 for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping, has known Caitlyn, 68, since she was Olympic gold medalist Bruce. They also share the Kardashian connection: Long before Caitlyn married into the family, O.J. was best buds with Kris’ first husband, Robert. O.J. should be interested in the show, a source says, but there’s a snag: Caitlyn has “wanted nothing to do with O.J.” since the NFL star was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.

Though they haven’t approached her yet, producers are hoping to convince Caitlyn to sign on by pitching it as “an informative, interview-type show,” the source says, in which she introduces O.J. to the new Caitlyn and asks him probing questions about his ups and downs. “If they do it right,” says the source, “it would be fascinating.”

And while the public, might be hesitant to watch such a reunion, the producers are convinced plenty of people will tune in to view the show. “Love them or hate them,” says a source, “putting Caitlyn and O.J. in the same room would be must-see TV.”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\121fake.txt

"Alex Jones Vindicated in ""Pizzagate"" Controversy

""Alex Jones, purveyor of the independent investigative news website Infowars and host of The Alex Jones Show, has been vindicated in his claims regarding the so-called ""Pizzagate"" controversy. Jones and others uncovered evidence last year that top Democratic Party officials were involved in a bizarre, satanic child sex cult and pornography ring using the Washington D.C. pizza parlor Comet Ping Pong Pizza as a front. The allegations rocked the Democratic Party and may have caused serious damage to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Top U.S. federal investigators have now confirmed that they have verified many of these claims after executing raids on the offices of several of the key players. Charges are expected to be filed in the coming days. The news comes as a welcome vindication for Jones, who has been accused by many mainstream media outlets of being a conspiracy theorist and of publishing ""fake news"". Mr. Jones has often drawn controversy, and was scapegoated in media reports as an example of how inaccurate and misleading news proliferated on social media websites like Facebook, Youtube and Twitter during the 2016 election. Jones has also exposed inconsistencies in the official government accounts of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown Connecticut.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\biz01.fake.txt

"Mariah Carey’s manager was always hungry for fame

Long before she managed Mariah Carey, Stella Bulochnikov was a standup comedian.

Going by her married name, Stella Stolper, the tough-talking Russian native competed on Season 4 of “Last Comic Standing” while pregnant with her second child.

In a clip from an episode that aired June 20, 2006, she jokes about her pregnancy, telling the crowd, “I love the babies! I want to have more kids, really, I do! I just can’t take the pain, and the nausea and all that weight. And I’m not talking about the nine months of being pregnant, I’m talking about the two minutes the old man’s on top of me.”

Why Mariah Carey's manager is more like a 'dictator'
Unfortunately for Bulochnikov, the audience couldn’t take her jokes: She was voted off in the same episode.

Her efforts at comedy stardom may lend credence to rumors that Bulochnikov, an experienced TV producer and the mastermind behind “Mariah’s World,” is eager for her own fame.

“Stella is the one who really wants to be the reality star. She even filmed a pilot for herself last year,” an insider who used to work with the self-proclaimed “Russian dictator” previously told Page Six. “This will likely be more of a TV launching vehicle for her. It’s going to be like the Stella show, which is what she’s always wanted. She is definitely very much out for herself, and this is a golden opportunity for her because she wants to be famous. She wants to be the one in the magazines.”

The source added, “Stella is the furthest thing from a manager. She’s a TV producer. She’s practically moved in with Mariah and now she has so much stuff on her that she can get her to do anything. She’s pulling the strings, and Mariah does whatever she says.”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\156fake.txt
"CHINA: MINER FOUND ALIVE AFTER 17 YEARS UNDERGROUND
While they were exploring the galleries, they stumbled upon Cheung Wai, a 59-year-old survivor from the 2001 accident, obviously in a rather bad shape.

Wai was immediately taken to the hospital where a complete evaluation of his physical and mental states will be done over the next weeks.

The poor man had remained trapped underground with the bodies of 78 of his dead coworkers after an earthquake of a magnitude of 7,8 hit the region and caused the wooden support structure of the mine to crumble and collapse.

Somehow lucky in his misfortune, Mr. Cheung was saved by the fact that a ventilation duct still connected his underground prison to the surface, allowing him access to air that was sufficiently pure to keep him alive.
Wai managed to survive thanks to an emergency stash of rice and water, stored in an underground depot, conceived especially for this kind of case.

The man complemented his diet by catching and eating the countless rats that pullulate in the mine, as well as collecting large quantities of some sort of phosphorescent moss, which constituted his only source of vitamins. 
Even though Wai was suffering from great physical and mental stress, he managed to give proper burials to all of his comrades, spending almost a year in this great selfless act.

Mining accidents remain common in China, despite growing measures by the government to reduce the problem, which killed more than 4000 miners a year at the beginning of the millennium.

Over the last years, the authorities have been cracking down on many unregulated mining operations which account for almost 80 percent of the country’s 16,000 mines.

The closure of about 1,000 dangerous small mines last year helped to cut in half the average number of miners killed, to about six a day, in the first months of this year, according to government statistics.

The case of Mr. Cheung remains unique, however, and constitutes a world record, according to the universally recognized authority on record-breaking achievement, Guinness.
The former record for surviving underground was of 142 days and was held by a British man named Geoff Smith. He had been voluntarily buried in the backyard of the Railway Inn, his favorite pub, with the intention of breaking the record.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\46.txt

Jaden Smith, the son of rapper-actor legend Will Smith, has announced a new fashion line, which he titled “666.” Despite 666 being highly regarded as an evil number which references the mark of the beast, Jaden says the fashion line was inspired by God.

In an interview with Rolling Stone, Jaden spoke about his fashion line:

“God exists in all things that surround the fire that burns in the sky. She is responsible for all spontaneous ideas. In fact, 666 is not an evil number. This number is actually three part and represents the six angels that descended from the six Heavens, who are searching for the six prophets who are meant to lead the masses. Each prophet will be the exalted leader of that heaven. I have been chosen by one of those angels as one of those prophets. This line is not just clothing. Clothing is meant to cover, while 666 is meant to transform. To wear these clothes is to seek protection from the ills of the world and to pledge allegiance to my Heaven.”

"Tortoise, hippo friendship deepens post tsunami
NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters Life!) - A giant tortoise and an orphaned baby hippo who forged an unusual friendship after the 2004 tsunami in southeast Asia are the stars of a new Web site so fans can follow their progress.

Mzee, a 130-year-old Aldabran tortoise, became a surrogate parent and inseparable friend to hippo Owen who was washed out to sea off the coast of Kenya, rescued by villagers and taken to a wildlife park where the tortoise lived.

The devastating Indian Ocean tsunami that hit in December 2004 left 230,000 people killed or missing, including 170,000 in Indonesia.

The animals’ friendship came to international attention when New York-based father and daughter team, Craig and Isabella Hatkoff, teamed up with the park’s chief environmentalist Paula Kahumbu to write a book about the pair, “Owen & Mzee: The True Story of a Remarkable Friendship.”

They have now released a second book, published by Scholastic, chronicling the deepening friendship, with Owen and Mzee living, sleeping and playing together, but also creating a language of their own.

“They have created sounds unique to hippo or to tortoise and use gentle nods and pushes to communicate with one another,” said a spokeswoman from Scholastic which has just released

“Owen & Mzee: The Language of Friendship.”

The second installment in the animals’ story follows their remarkable friendship at Haller Park Animal Sanctuary nearMombasa, Kenya, which is operated by Lafarge EcoSystems, a unit of Kenyan cement maker Bamburi.

But as well as updating readers on the friendship, Hatkoff’s publishing company, Turtle Pond Publications, this week also launched Web site www.owenandmzee.com to update fans on the animals with a weekly blog from caretaker Stephen Tuei.

“Their true story that borders on the unbelievable teaches us many beautiful lessons on many levels,” said Hatkoff in a statement.

“The Web site allows us to continually update the public on the pair’s current developments and offers kids new set of online creativity resources and applications at the same time.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\9.txt

Both women are invested in humanitarian work, but the first time they crossed paths, in London on June 12, Angie made it clear that Amal was persona non grata - and even blew her off when Amal requested a public greeting in front of photographers. ""Angie feels competitive with Amal,"" the source reveals. ""She has been running from her past for years, and although she's done a fabulous job reinventing herself, she continues to feel like an uneducated outsider.""

Of course, the victims in Angie and Amal's standoff are Brad and George, whose friendship has unraveled in recent years, allegedly due to Angelina's controlling behavior. ""Angie has forbidden Brad to speak to George,"" the insider reports. ""She's walled him off from so many of his old friends that Brad is getting fed up.""

Racial bias against black students begins long before they get to their teens - it starts in preschool, according to a study released today from the Yale Child Study Center.

The study was conducted as a two-part experiment: in the first part, educators watched black and white children together, and in the second, they read vignettes on misbehaving students. In each situation, they were asked to identify and rate bad behavior.

The researchers showed 135 teachers a video of four children playing - a black boy and girl and a white boy and girl - and asked them to look for potentially problematic behavior.

"Kanye West Skipped Serena Williams’ Wedding To Avoid ‘Awkward’ Run In With Beyonce

While Kim Kardashian made it to Serena Williams’ wedding, Kanye West was noticeably not her plus one. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyoncé at all costs.

There’s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena’s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn’t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. “It was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena’s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim’s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyoncé, a close friend of Serena’s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,” a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.
“Kanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyoncé and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena’s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,” our source continues. Yeezy hasn’t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone’s wedding. See pics of guests at Serena’s wedding, here.

Kim played it safe and made it a girl’s trip to Serena’s big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloe‘s BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. Beyoncé also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyoncé have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena’s wedding, but were separated by Bey’s former Destiny’s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.’s  fairytale wedding and not anyone else’s drama.

During one of his many meet-and-greet sessions at children’s hospitals across the nation, John Cena made an embarrassing gaffe by saying “You can’t see me” to a little blind boy.

An awkward hush fell over the lounge in Manhattan Pediatric Hospital, where several children and their parents were gathered for the much-anticipated meeting with Cena.

"RED SEA: ARCHAEOLOGISTS DISCOVER REMAINS OF EGYPTIAN ARMY FROM THE BIBLICAL EXODUS
Suez | Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of  Ras Gharib.
The team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artifacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age.

The scientists led by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor.

The remains of two war chariots were also discovered scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters.

They estimate that more than 5,000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size may have perished on the site.

This magnificient blade from an egyptian khopesh, was certainly the weapon of an important character. It was discovered near the remains of a highly decorated war chariot, suggesting it could have belonged to a prince or nobleman.
Many clues on the site have brought Professor Gader and his team to conclude that the bodies could be linked to the famous episode of the Exodus.

First of all, the ancient soldiers seem to have died on dry ground, since no traces of boats or ships have been found in the area.

The positions of the bodies and the fact that they were stuck in a vast quantity of clay and rock imply that they could have died in a mudslide or a tidal wave.
The sheer number of bodies suggests that a large ancient army perished on the site, and the dramatic way by which they were killed, seem to corroborate the biblical version of the Red Sea Crossing when the army of the Egyptian Pharaoh was destroyed by the returning waters that Moses had parted.

This new find certainly proves that there was indeed an Egyptian army of large size that was destroyed by the waters of the Red Sea during the reign of King Akhenaten.

The famous biblical account of the ""Red Sea Crossing"" was dismisseded by many scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.
For centuries, the famous biblical account of the “Red Sea Crossing” was dismissed by most scholars and historians as more symbolic than historical.

“This astounding discovery brings undeniable scientific proof that one the most famous episodes of the Old Testament was indeed based on a historical event,” Professor Gader said during the press conference.
“It brings a brand new perspective on a story that many historians have been considering for years as a work of fiction and suggesting that other biblical stories like the Plagues of Egypt could indeed have a historical base.

A lot more research and many more recovery operations are to be expected on the site over the next few years, as Professor Gader and his team have already announced their desire to retrieve the rest of the bodies and artefacts from was has turned out to be one of the richest archaeological underwater sites ever discovered.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\47.txt

"Blake Griffin: Did He Kick His Baby Mama Out For Kendall Jenner?

It's only been a few weeks since the world learned that Blake Griffin and Kendall Jenner are dating, but it looks as though the lanky couple is moving very fast.

They've been hanging out in public; she's already banned from the Staples Center ...

Yes, they've checking off items from the ""new Kardashian-professional athlete relationship"" checklist at breakneck speed.

There's just one problem.

Neither Blake nor Kendall was 100 percent single when they met, which means they're both in the process of distancing themselves from their most recent exes as they simultaneously attempt to build a new relationship together.

Insiders say Kendall was still dating A$AP Rocky when she started hooking up with Blake, but it sounds like that situation won't present much of a challenge.

“He isn’t the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend, so she’s playing the field too,"" one insider said of Rocky.

So we imagine he wasn't too torn up about being cut from Team Kendall.

Blake, on the other hand, is in a bit of a tighter spot.

The LA Clippers forward has two kids with Brynn Cameron, whom he dated for several years.

Though the couple had experienced relationship troubles in recent months and even lived apart during a trial separation, sources say Cameron was blindsided by the news that Griffin was dating Kendall.

According to sources close to the couple, Cameron unexpectedly moved out of the home she previously shared with Griffin this week.

And naturally, many are claiming that Kendall is to blame.

""Both Brynn and Blake have been staying at rented places since their breakup happened. It seemed like they wanted to give it time for the dust to settle before disrupting the kids with a big move,"" one insider reveals.

""That said, Brynn feels totally betrayed and mortified that Blake has chosen to be so public with Kendall, and she just wants this whole mess to be over,"" the informant adds.

""He’s in Clippers training camp now, so she figured it was the perfect time to do it.""

So it sounds like Blake and Brynn were headed in the vague direction of Splitsville, but Kendall was what drove them to finally call it quits.

Fans are reportedly angry, as Brynn was a beloved member of the Clippers community.

Brad Pitt ""lunged"" at his son Maddox during a flight on a private jet as the teen tried to defend his mum Angelina Jolie, it has been claimed.

The actor - whose wife Angelina filed for divorce and ended their 12-year relationship following the reported incident - is accused of being ""wasted"" and ""screaming"" while in the air with his partner and two of their children.

Now, according to TMZ, it's claimed Brad began arguing with his wife mid-air, and when Maddox jumped up to defend her, he allegedly ""lunged"" at his son.

The site claims ""Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband"", but it's not clear what led to the alleged incident, or if it was even intentional.

But a source told Mirror Celebs: ""These claims are exaggerated and fabricated. It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.

""They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of disagreements. Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.""

Another source added that the FBI is investigating the claims as a jurisdictional issue due to the alleged incident taking place in the air.

The insider added Pitt - who is ""cooperating fully"" with authorities - denies being abusive and wants to do what is best for his children.

As the plane touched down, The Sun reports that the World War Z star allegedly continued his ""rant"" at the 15-year-old before then trying to leave the place in a fuel truck on the tarmac.

The Mirror understands the alleged incident was the tipping point for Jolie to call time on their 12-year relationship.

"Angelina Jolie Threatens Brad Pitt: Don't Bring The Kids Around Jennifer Aniston

Although Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, opted to make their legal docs involving their split completely private on Jan. 10, 2017, Angie's reportedly got a new demand to add to their split negotiations. She doesn't want Brad's reported new texting buddy, Jennifer Aniston, 48, anywhere near her kids, according to In Touch.

""As Angie and Brad's divorce talks continue, she's demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen,"" the mag reported. Brad and Angie share six children together - Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.

The actor has reportedly been leaning on his ex-wife while he deals with his emotional split from Angie. He and Jen married in July 2000 and ended their courtship in Oct. 2005 after he met Angie on the set of their love, action flick, Mr & Mrs. Smith. However, he's reportedly reconciled with Jen via phone. The two have allegedly been exchanging sweet messages over various phone calls and text messages, according to the mag. To make matters worse, Angie apparently knows about Brad and Jen's alleged newfound relationship and she's not happy whatsoever.

As for Brad's take on Angie's reported request that he should keep Jen far away from their six children? - ""Brad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,"" the mag reported. In fact, ""He isn't going to cave in to Angie's ridiculous demand... Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences."" Harsh...

While Brad, Angie or Jennifer have not commented on this wild report, here's what HollywoodLife.com knows: ""Angelina was never able to get over her obsession with Brad and Jennifer's relationship,"" a source EXCLUSIVELY told us. As a matter of fact, Angie always feared that Brad would go back with Jen. Wow.

Things haven't been going too well for Brad throughout his nasty split with Angie. When she filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2016, she also requested sole physical custody of their six children. Brad and Angie reached a private, temporary custody agreement on Sept. 30, which granted her full physical custody, and him with visitation approved by a therapist.

After multiple disputes between the couple in scathing court docs, they decided to release a joint statement on Jan. 10, 2017, which revealed that they agreed to keep their court docs private. Since then, the exes have remained tight-lipped on the status of their broken marriage.

"Taylor Swift Goes Naked in '...Ready for It?' Music Video Teaser

Nope, definitely not ready for this! Taylor Swift released a 15-second teaser for the music video for her new song “…Ready for It?” on Monday, October 23.

In the clip, the Grammy winner, 27, struts down a hallway with a hood covering her head. She then turns into a badass robot and fights off a group of bad guys. Oh, and she’s completely naked during it all (or at least wearing a nude-colored bodysuit). The intense preview is filled with lightning, magic and action, and casts her in a dark, superhero-like light.

“…Ready For It? Official Music Video out Thursday night. #ReadyForItMusicVideo,” she captioned the teaser on all of her social media accounts.

Swift released “…Ready for It” on September 3, just a few days after premiering “Look What You Made Me Do,” the lead single from her upcoming sixth studio album, Reputation. The electronic song, which was first teased during a Sunday Night Football broadcast, peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, making it Swift’s 22nd song to land in the top 10.

The “Shake It Off” singer later released a love song titled “Gorgeous” on Friday, October 20 — and she has plenty more on the way. A source exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month that Reputation “chronicles her feuds” with longtime foes Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry and ex Calvin Harris. “It will be across multiple songs, somewhat cryptically, but also obvious,” the insider told Us.

Jennifer Aniston, 47, has dreamed of becoming a mom for a long time - is she finally getting her wish? Maybe! After all, according to a new report, the actress is expecting her first child with husband Justin Theroux, 44. But are Jen and Justin ACTUALLY about to become new parents? The answer may surprise you!

""She's pregnant,"" a reported friend of the couple revealed to InTouch magazine. ""She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years. Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too - she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.""

However, we have spoken to Jennifer's rep directly and we've been told that Jennifer is NOT pregnant and the entire story is ""fabricated."" Aw, we can't say we're not disappointed though. Jennifer and Justin WOULD make fantastic parents!

But nonetheless, while vacationing in the Bahamas on a romantic getaway, Jennifer and Justin allegedly looked like the perfect couple. Flaunting their PDA, the two definitely seemed more in love than ever - talk about the perfect vacay. Justin was also allegedly super attentive to his wife, aw!

""The baby has turned him from a guy who didn't seem like he was meant for marriage into beyond supportive,"" the mag's insider dished. ""He was by Jen's side as she dealt with the death of her mom, and he's been waiting on her hand and food in the early days of the pregnancy.""

And while we know now that Jennifer is NOT actually pregnant, we still love seeing this couple get along. It seems like their romantic trip is helping them get closer than ever - and we are ALL for that!

Witnesses did claim that Jennifer refrained from drinking alcohol and smoking while on the island. ""She's dealing with exhaustion and experiencing morning sickness,"" the magazine's insider gushed. ""She's put on about 10 pounds so far."" But honestly, people's weights have a tendency to fluctuate - so just because Jennifer may have gained some weight, doesn't mean she's pregnant.

It’s no secret that Chelsea Handler, 42, has never been a fan of Angelina Jolie. In fact, she’s been team Jennifer Aniston since the beginning. But now, the web of friendship and rivalry is all tangled up following a seriously shocking report from Naughty Gossip. The publication claims that the comedian is getting close to Brad Pitt, which kinda’ seems like a stab in the back for both Angie and the Friends alum. If true, how twisted is that?! “Chelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer,” a source tells Naughty Gossip on Aug. 17. “She always blamed Angelina for the nasty split. But now that she isn’t friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad.”

Huh…apparently the bond between Chelsea and Jen wasn’t unbreakable like we once thought. But would the talkshow hostess really betray her (former) friend like that? Would things would Brad actually turn romantic? For now it sounds like Chelsea is only interested in collaborating with the Fight Club hunk professionally. “Chelsea has long been a fan of Brad’s ‘Plan B’ production company and is talking with them about a few projects,” the source continues. “Don’t be surprised if we see Brad and Chelsea having lunch together soon!”

We know what you’re thinking — when the heck did Chelsea and Jen stop being friends?!

Then  you know we're playing through De'Aaron Fox. The rest of you take a back seat.'"" Sometimes  basketball is simple. Such was the case for Kentucky on Friday night at FedEx Forum. Fox  a freshman guard  was halfway through eviscerating U.C.L.A. in a South regional semifinal of the N.C.A.A. tournament  and Calipari reminded his players to continue feeding him the ball. The second-seeded Wildcats heeded that message in an 86-75 victory that put them one game from the Final Four. On Sunday afternoon  Kentucky will play top-seeded North Carolina in the regional final. ""I'm looking forward to the game just because I like my team  said Calipari, adding: I'm jacked up.

"Liam Payne Just Dissed Harry Styles' Solo Music

Harry Styles' new music isn't for everyone, not even his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne.

Cheryl Cole's beau stopped by Music Choice to chat about a range of topics but things got a little dicey when he was asked about Niall Horan's new single ""Slow Hands"" and Harry's ""Sign of the Times.""

Liam called Niall's track ""great"" and ""cool"" but boy did he not mince words when it came to his review of Harry's debut single as a solo artist.

""I'll be honest with you, it's not my sort of music,"" he shared. ""It's not something I'd listen to, but I think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That's the way I'd put it best, I think."" You think?

""I think that the funny thing is, [Harry] would say the same thing about me because he doesn't really listen to hip-hop music, whereas it's like my song's more ‘Rack City' and his song is more of a different era to something I'd listen to, I guess.""

Fair enough, Liam, and thank you for the clarification.
Just a few days ago, while promoting ""Sign of the Times,"" Harry explained to USA Today that writing his new album was ""like therapy.""

""I was very much working out what I wanted the album to be up until picking the tracklisting, and I wanted people to go through that with me when listening to that, instead of picking a sound and writing ten of the same things.""

Well, it looks like Harry and his legions of fans are happy with his new music regardless of what any of his former bandmates think!",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\197fake.txt

"Green Eggs and Ham

Many of us grew up enjoying the wildly imaginative rhyming works written and illustrated by Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known to us as Dr. Seuss. Bartholomew and the Oobleck, If I Ran the Zoo, Horton Hears a Who!, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and many other books involving “ludicrous situations pursued with relentless logic” were the core of many a child’s personal library. In 1957, Seuss produced a classic children’s tale, The Cat in the Hat, using only the words on an average first-grader’s vocabulary list. This work was followed by a series of books employing an ever more limited vocabulary: Ten Apples up on Top!, Hop on Pop, Fox in Socks, and the book that initiated this trend (and is perhaps the best known of all of Seuss’ efforts), Green Eggs and Ham.

What prompted this minimalist trend by Dr. Seuss? A dare from his editor, Bennett Cerf, that he write a book using no more than fifty different words. Seuss took Cerf up on his challenge and produced a classic children’s work many of us can still recite from memory.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\17.txt

"Roald Dahl Wrote This Painful Plea For Vaccinations After His Own Daughter Died Of Measles
Author Roald Dahl penned a heartbreaking letter in 1988, urging parents to vaccinate their kids, in which he shared the story of his heartbreak over his own daughter's death from measles.

According to the author's website, Olivia ""Twenty"" Dahl, the oldest daughter of Roald and his wife, Patricia, died in November 1962. A letter written by Dahl about her death was featured in a pamphlet from The Sandwell Health Authority in 1988.

Read the full text of the letter below, via HuffPost UK:

Measles: A Dangerous Illness
Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old. As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it.

Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything.

“Are you feeling all right?” I asked her.

“I feel all sleepy,” she said.

In an hour, she was unconscious. In 12 hours she was dead.

The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her.

That was 24 years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.

On the other hand, there is today something that parents can do to make sure that this sort of tragedy does not happen to a child of theirs. They can insist that their child is immunised against measles.

I was unable to do that for Olivia in 1962 because in those days a reliable measles vaccine had not been discovered. Today a good and safe vaccine is available to every family and all you have to do is to ask your doctor to administer it.

It is not yet generally accepted that measles can be a dangerous illness. Believe me, it is. In my opinion parents who now refuse to have their children immunised are putting the lives of those children at risk.

In America, where measles immunisation is compulsory, measles like smallpox, has been virtually wiped out.

Here in Britain, because so many parents refuse, either out of obstinacy or ignorance or fear, to allow their children to be immunised, we still have a hundred thousand cases of measles every year.

Out of those, more than 10,000 will suffer side effects of one kind or another. At least 10,000 will develop ear or chest infections. About 20 will die.

LET THAT SINK IN.

Every year around 20 children will die in Britain from measles.

So what about the risks that your children will run from being immunised?

They are almost non-existent. Listen to this. In a district of around 300,000 people, there will be only one child every 250 years who will develop serious side effects from measles immunisation! That is about a million to one chance.

I should think there would be more chance of your child choking to death on a chocolate bar than of becoming seriously ill from a measles immunisation.

So what on earth are you worrying about? It really is almost a crime to allow your child to go unimmunised.

The ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunisation should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible.

Incidentally, I dedicated two of my books to Olivia, the first was ‘James and the Giant Peach’. That was when she was still alive. The second was ‘The BFG’, dedicated to her memory after she had died from measles.

You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\2.txt
"Photos Of Angelina Jolie In A Wedding Dress Claim To Prove Quickie Marriage To Rando Brit After Brad Pitt Divorce

Photos of Angelina’s Jolie’s wedding dress have been making the rounds on the celebrity rumors circuit these past few months after an In Touch front page cover claimed Angie got married to a British man just eight months after the split with Brad Pitt. This would be Angelina’s fourth marriage if the tabloid’s article was true, but based upon other reports, it seems safe to say this surprise wedding is likely fake news.

Back in April, In Touch ran a cover story declaring, “Angelina’s Shocking Surprise: Wedding In Cambodia! Marriage No. 4 Just 8 Months After Split With Brad.” The tabloid was running with the idea that Angelina Jolie’s divorce from Brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a “wealthy, 40-something Brit.” Angelina’s dating of this “philanthropist business man” was supposedly being “shielded” from the public “by her closest friends.” Worse, Angelina’s children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned.

“A quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback [to Brad Pitt],” claimed an unnamed “family friend” who is the supposed source for In Touch.

While Angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are Angelina and Brad’s six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. In April, Gossip Cop pointed out that “this tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readers” and an unnamed source of their own claimed that Angie’s 2017 wedding rumors are “beyond ridiculous.”

Angelina Jolie Relying On Kids To Cheer Her Up After Brad Pitt Split — Divorce Details Revealed

Fast forward in time and In Touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. Now, they are running a cover allegedly showing Angelina Jolie’s wedding in Cambodia. The front cover and the way it features Angelina’s wedding dress are designed to give the impression that Angie has already been married. But if you break open the tabloid, In Touch is claiming Angelina is still planning a future 2017 wedding in Battambang, Cambodia.

The latest edition is still alleging that Jolie has “quietly fallen for a wealthy 40-something British philanthropist and businessman, and she’s eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from Brad is finalized.” The same “family friend” is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie star’s plans for a small wedding that celebrates the Cambodian culture. Pitt is supposedly not “standing in her way anymore.” The funny part is that no one knows the name of Angelina’s dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail.

In this case, Gossip Cop claims the “tabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazine’s dreadful reporting.” The real problem is that it’s not merely bad information from an unknown source, Gossip Cop alleges that In Touch “has simply been making it all up” by generating fake news.

What is the truth? After all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Ryan Gosling, and Eva Mendes. In the end, In Touch and its secret “family friend” stand alone in reporting Angelina Jolie’s wedding plans, while Gossip Cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has “created a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.” It seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked.

"Body Is Mistaken for a Halloween Display
LOS ANGELES — The body of a man slumped over patio furniture on his balcony in Marina del Rey was mistaken for Halloween décor last week and remained undisturbed for five days.

Sheriff’s deputies were called to the complex Thursday evening and found the man, Mostafa Mahmoud Zayed, 75, dead. He had been shot through the eye.

“He looked fake,” said Austin Raishbrook, 33, who lives nearby. “It looked like somebody had thrown a dummy over the back of a chair.”

Sheriff’s deputies believe that Mr. Zayed committed suicide, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. “Our investigators don’t think there was any foul play here,” he said.

Mr. Raishbrook said he had just returned home from work at the news-gathering agency he owns when sirens began to wail along Bora Bora Way, a residential street overlooking boat slips and a main waterway.

“I ran over there with my camera equipment,” he said. “There was blood on the balcony, and he was visible from the street. But it really did not look like a real person up there.”

The coroner’s autopsy report, released Saturday, showed that Mr. Zayed probably died last Sunday. Mr. Whitmore said neighbors “reported hearing popping noises on Sunday.”

Most people in the complex of 800 units may not have noticed Mr. Zayed, Mr. Whitmore said. Hard rain and cold winds kept many indoors for most of the week. The buildings in the complex are turned so that the third floor — where Mr. Zayed’s body was slouched toward a railing — is partly obscured from the street.

“I finally took a walk last night with my dog, and I saw the ambulance there,” said Victoria Sepe, 61, who lives nearby but did not see the body. “It’s terrible.”

The apartment complex sits on a narrow strip of land leading to the sea, said residents reached on the phone Friday. It is a quiet street, they said, with upscale apartment buildings.

The most pressing security matters are usually “seals jumping on the docks and making too much noise,” Ms. Sepe said.

Hillary Clinton was in Florida last week, giving a speech citing the staggering statistics about American gun violence, as the San Bernardino shooting was taking place. 

“Ninety Americans a day die from gun violence, homicide, suicides, tragic avoidable accidents — 33,000 Americans a year die,” Clinton told the crowd. “It is time for us to say we are going to have comprehensive background checks, we are gonna close the gun show loopholes.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\7.txt
"Drama On ‘The Voice!’ Kelly Clarkson And Jennifer Hudson “Cannot Stand Each Other”

Behind the scenes, the two divas are feuding! While the finalists of The Voice are getting ready to compete for the grand prize, sources on the set revealed that the real completion is in fact between superstar singers Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson!

As fans of The Voice probably already know, last week, the network announced that Hudson and Clarkson, both 35 years old, have signed contracts to join the vocal competition.

However, the two divas quickly clarified that they would not appear on the same season of the hit show!

Reportedly, we will see Hudson on it sooner, as she is set to coach during season 13, while Clarkson will have to wait until season 14 to show herself.

With that being said, one question, in particular, comes to mind – why can’t they appear on The Voice at the same time?

The answer comes from an on-set source who told us that “Kelly and Jennifer really cannot stand each other!”

“Kelly was completely blindsided when she saw that Jennifer was cast because no one had told her about it,” the insider added.

But even though Hudson and Clarkson are not going to meet on the show, after all, that doesn’t mean the set is safe from the drama.

Considering that Miley Cyrus is set to return for Season 13, the insider revealed that pretty much everyone hopes for some “cattiness” between her and Jennifer Hudson.

“It would be so great!”

What do you think of Jennifer Hudson being added as a vocal coach for season 13? Was she the right choice?

"Kim Kardashian ‘Allergic’ To Jewelry After Traumatic Paris Robbery

Even though it’s been a while since then and we all thought the reality TV star was a lot better, it seems like the horrifying Paris robbery is very much still on Kim Kardashian’s mind.

We have learned that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is still unable to wear her jewelry.

As fans may already be aware, ever since she was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris suite last year, Kim has been battling panic attacks and anxiety that rendered her homebound for months.

When she finally returned to her public life, the Kardashian seemed a whole different person – a lot more modest and reserved than usual.

Apparently, although she looked like she was getting better, sources say anxiety and panic attacks still take place and wearing jewelry is what triggers them!

‘She thought she would be over this by now, but if anything it’s getting worse. Kim is much stronger about most aspects of the trauma, but whenever she puts on a heavy necklace or even a favorite watch it gives her panic attacks and terrible flashbacks. She is looking fantastic and can cope with the occasional light piece of jewelry, but feels naked without being able to wear some of her favorite necklaces and earrings,’ the insider said about Kim’s more casual style these days.

Her trauma over the robbery that could have cost her her life has even led Kardashian to attend therapy in order to cope with the trauma.

But despite the fact that her therapist is of great help, they are still figuring out how to fix her accessories issue.

For now, the only solution is to wear as little jewelry as possible.

Meanwhile, we can reveal that Kim will also not return for Fashion Week in Paris this year.

"Ellen's $40M Haunted Mansion

ELLEN DEGENERES fears she's got a creepy house-guest in her new $40 million mansion – a ghost!

The talk-show host, 56, has repeatedly been spooked by eerie noises and believes the home she shares with wife Portia de Rossi is haunted by its original owner, who died there in 2009, a source says.

""The house had been remodeled, so Ellen thought it would have no trace of the former owner,"" said a pal. ""But she was wrong. Within a few nights of moving in, Ellen started hearing random noises, including foot­steps and doors opening and closing.

""Then, in the middle of the night, she heard a woman's faint cry.

She hasn't had a solid night's sleep since she moved in.""

She said she's never been a believer in ghosts or spirits, the source continued, ""but she doesn't have any other explanation for the mysterious sounds and voices.""

The boo-tiful mansion, a 13,000-square-foot architectural masterpiece, was built for real es­tate developer Sidney Brody and his wife Frances in 1951. Known as the Brody House, it's located in the exclusive Holmby Hills neighborhood next door to the famed Playboy Mansion. Brody died in 1983. His wife, a renowned art collector and philanthropist, passed away in the house at age 93 after a long illness.

After her death, an inves­tor purchased the home and completely remodeled it. Real estate maven Ellen then bought the nine-bedroom, eight-bathroom spread in early January.

""It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Ellen couldn't pass up,"" said the source.

According to the source, Ellen said she's convinced the noises and voices she hears are Frances Brody's, and Ellen thinks Mrs. Brody's spirit can't bear to part with the house, even in the afterlife.

""Friends have convinced Ellen to conduct a spiritual cleansing ceremony in the house,"" the source said. ""She doesn't want her new home to have any bad energy, and she's not going to share it with Frances Brody.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\070fake.txt

"Jay-Z: 'Jesus Is Fake News; Lucifer Is Way Of Truth And Light'

“Jesus Christ is the original fake news,” according to Jay-Z, who claims “Jesus never walked the earth, y’all being played” and “the idea of Jesus is just a tool used by smart people to control dumb people.”

Going as far as to claim “Lucifer is the way of truth and light“, Jay-Z also credited his self-described “new humility and maturity” to “fully embracing my older bother, Lucifer.”

During an backstage rant at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans on Friday, Jay-Z also claimed Satanism has “gotten a bad rap” due to “mentally challenged Christians and their desire to be slaves,” but Satanism is actually “the highest form of being.”

“There is real spirituality and guidance in the Church of Satan that you just don’t get in Christianity, because Christianity is a fake religion, built by assholes,” Jay-Z said. “Hands up, how many Christians here have prayed to God for years and aint gotten nothing back, just silence and emptiness? Be honest. It’s OK.”

As the small crowd of ticket winners began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced, “I can answer for y’all because I am free. Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.“

“I’m telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me. I will give you this one guarantee, if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer, you will taste success. The secret of the universe opens up to you. It is immediate and glorious.”

The 99 Problems rapper also hinted at his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling audiences to ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them. Instead of respecting the rules, Jay-Z instructed his audience to “Do what thou wilt“.

It has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley, the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema.

The religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed; “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law“. This statement indicates that adherents, who are known as Thelemites, should seek out and follow their own true path in life, known as their True Will.

Jay-Z’s Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper, he reinvented his image as a dark lord, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game.

Since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image, however the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans suggests he is far from a reformed character, and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.

The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\132fake.txt
"Has Tom Hiddleston's 'Embarrassing' Romance With Taylor Swift Cost Him a Job?

Yikes, Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift's romance (showmance?) really isn't having the effect that their PR teams had hoped for, with Tom reportedly losing a huge contract due to the ""embarrassing"" display.

Last month it was reported that fashion giant Armani was considering using Tom as its new face, replacing Taylor's ex, Calvin Harris. (Interesting!)

However, it seems the Italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to Hiddleston's recent publicity-hungry antics with his new girlfriend.

Executives apparently fear that they will be seen as ""cashing in"" on the drama, something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from.

A source shared: ""Tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from Calvin.""

""Obviously with Tom now being Taylor's other half and the Calvin past deal, it would generate huge media coverage and headlines.

""But Armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better. Armani would hate to be seen as getting PR for their brand by riding on Taylor Swift's coattails, so Tom will not get the job.""

The insider continued: ""While Tom is without doubt one of the sexiest actors of his generation, he may not be the right fit this time.

""The brand is looking at attracting 30-somethings and under, so Tom may be a little too old."" Ouch.

Tom hit the headlines when he was conveniently photographed embracing Taylor on an isolated beach less than three weeks after she had split from her long-term boyfriend, Calvin.

The pair has embarked on a eyebrow-raising display of love across the globe, with Taylor even meeting Tom's mother in front of the waiting photographers after just nine days of dating.

Tom was relentlessly mocked after donning an ""I [heart] Taylor Swift"" tank top during Fourth of July celebrations and wondered if that might have a negative impact on his career (while others wondered if it was just a joke).

If Armani is indeed shying away from the star, that negative impact might be painfully real.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\045fake.txt

"Did Charlize Theron Break Keanu Reeves' Heart By Dating Sean Penn?

Charlize Theron may have broken Keanu Reeves' tender heart by hooking up with fellow thespian Sean Penn.

The Monster star and the Gangster Squad alum were reportedly spotted together on a beach not too long ago, fueling rumors that the pair were starting to get romantic. Adding fuel to the flames of speculations were photos of Theron snuggling up to Penn at a pre-Oscar party over the weekend.

Check out Charlize Theron and Sean Penn hanging out at Pharrell Williams' shindig below. Chances are their appearance at the gathering will only cause rumors of their rumored romance to spiral completely out of control.

Since Charlize Theron has reportedly found a boyfriend, a close ""friend"" told the folks over at OK! magazine that Keanu Reeves isn't exactly thrilled with the situation. Since he and Theron had an on-again off-again relationship for years, the 47 Ronin star is apparently a little depressed.

""To see her falling in love with Sean is really hurting him. Charlize and Keanu have been secretly on-and-off for so long. I think he thought they would eventually end up together for good. He's a little heartbroken,"" the insider dished to the publication.

Of course, Charlize Theron's new romance doesn't come without its own set of unique problems. According to Star, yet another anonymous source believes that the actress's mom is very worried that Penn could up and leave at any moment. It goes without saying that no one should take this information as gospel.

""The South African native if fearful that womanizing Sean will break her daughter's heart. While the protective mama bear has never minded their friendship, sources say she 'begged Charlize not to let it turn romantic,'"" the insider said.

If you're more concerned with Theron's career than her private life, then you definitely have a few projects headed to your neighborhood multiplex in the next few years.

"Germany and France signal willingness to delay Brexit
Germany and France have signalled their willingness to delay Brexit as Michel Barnier offered to renegotiate with Theresa May in the event that she is able to build a majority with Labour in favour of a closer relationship with the EU.

EU ambassadors also discussed the issue for the first time at a meeting in Brussels on Tuesday, as the member states attempted to decide on their terms for extending the negotiating time beyond 29 March.

With Downing Street opening cross-party talks after the government’s historic defeat, EU politicians and officials were looking ahead in case the prime minister finds a majority in the Commons for a fresh approach.

On Tuesday night, Emmanuel Macron, coming to the end of a seven-hour town hall meeting as news of May’s Brexit vote defeat came through, said he believed the British government would seek an extension to article 50 in order to renegotiate the deal before a second parliamentary vote. “I think that’s what they’ll do. I know them a bit,” said the French president. “In that case, we’ll look into it, and maybe we’ll make improvements on one or two things.”

However, he cautioned: “We’ve reached the maximum for what we can do with the deal.” He warned that the EU would not stop defending European interests “just to solve Britain’s domestic political issues”.

He added that the whole basis for Brexit was flawed: “It’s a referendum that has been manipulated, manipulated from outside by a lot of what we call fake news.”

Peter Altmaier, Germany’s economics minister, suggested he would see it “as a reasonable request” if the UK wanted an extension. Nathalie Loiseau, France’s EU affairs minister, confirmed that a delay would be possible in the right context.

A similar argument was made by Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, during a late-night private meeting with senior members of the European parliament in the hours immediately after the Commons vote. The EU has previously suggested that only a general election or second referendum could persuade them to delay Brexit.

On Wednesday, Macron became the first EU leader to publicly raise the prospect of an extension beyond European elections in May. “Maybe they will step over the European elections in order to find [negotiate] something else,” Macron said, comments that represent a subtle shift in tone, as France has long insisted that there could be no prolongation of article 50 beyond the elections.

During Wednesday’s meeting of ambassadors and senior EU officials, several member states raised the issue of extending the two years allowed under article 50 for withdrawal talks.

It is hoped that May might be able to construct a cross-party position to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Labour has said that it would support a deal involving a permanent customs union, a position that the prime minister nevertheless reiterated her opposition to on Wednesday.

Speaking to a full chamber of the European parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Barnier said the motivations of the MPs who delivered the rebuff to May – a defeat by 230 votes, the largest ever for a sitting government – were “contradictory”.

He said the Commons had failed to offer an alternative vision, and warned May that no progress could be made until she found a majority for a deal. “Objectively speaking, this vote is not a clear manifestation of a positive majority which would define an alternative project, and an alternative to the proposal on the table today,” Barnier said.

“So, in this context, it is up to the British authorities today or tomorrow to assess the outcome of this vote, and up to the British government to find how we are to take things forward on 29 March towards an orderly withdrawal.”

Barnier, whose speech was applauded by MEPs despite the problems being faced in ratifying the deal he brokered, told the parliament that he would not speculate on the “scenarios” opening up following the rejection of the deal. “Now, with this standstill, until we have found a way forward which will see a full majority we won’t be able to move forward, so this is why the future steps must be indicated very clearly … by the British government,” he said.

But the former French minister added: “I would like to remind you that your parliament, and unanimously the European council, have always said that if the UK chooses to shift its red lines in the future, and it makes that choice, a choice to be ambitious, and go beyond a simple free trade agreement, which would be quite something, then the European Union will be immediately ready to go hand in hand with that development and to give a favourable response.”

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Tuesday that there would be time to negotiate, but that it was “up to the British side, as the prime minister has announced, to tell us what happens next”.

The EU is willing to reopen the political declaration on the future relationship, a 26-page document that is not legally binding, but remains highly resistant to any suggestion of unpicking the 585-page withdrawal agreement.

Barnier told MEPs that whatever emerged from future talks, the withdrawal agreement would still need to contain the contentious Irish backstop for avoiding a hard border, which Brexiters fear will trap the UK in a customs union.

Philippe Lamberts, the leader of the Greens in the European parliament, said the withdrawal agreement containing the backstop would likely be received by rapporteurs, the MEPs who would present the draft to the chamber, next week as the EU continued on with its ratification process. “The withdrawal agreement will not be reopened because whatever deal we have, we need that”, he said.

Critics of May’s deal have called for a time limit or unilateral right to exit the arrangements. Barnier told MEPs: “The backstop that we agreed with the UK must remain a backstop, must remain a credible backstop. The backstop must remain a backstop.”

While EU officials once ruled out the UK remaining in the EU beyond elections in May 2019, attention is turning to legal fixes to permit an extension if Brexit talks drag on through the summer.

One idea is writing text into the 585-page withdrawal agreement that would allow British representatives to sit in the parliament Brussels and Strasbourg temporarily. The model would be a reverse copy of arrangements for countries joining the EU, when national parliaments send delegates to the European parliament if they join halfway through a term.

But not everyone agrees with this analysis. “The logical consequences of an extension is that they will have to participate in European elections,” the senior official said. EU lawyers have yet to express a view.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\33.txt

"Kanye West Enraged Taylor Swift Referenced Kim Kardashian’s Robbery In Music Video

Kanye West was emotionally unaffected by Taylor Swift’s ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ video… until she seemingly referenced Kim Kardashian’s 2016 Paris robbery. The rapper thinks it was a pretty low thing for Taylor to do.


Kanye West, 40, isn’t too happy that Taylor Swift, 27, targeted Kim Kardashian‘s Paris robbery situation in her music video for “Look What You Made Me Do”, HL has EXCLUSIVELY learned. “He was upset that Taylor exploited Kim’s robbery,” a source close to the rapper explains. “Kanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.” Ultimately, Ye’ “just feels as though it’s something that Taylor shouldn’t have mocked.”


As for the rest of the video? — Well, Kanye could care less. He and Kim, 36, weren’t bothered by the cryptic messages in the video that the internet consumed themselves with, trying to dissect. However, it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset. As you may know, Kim was robbed of her multi-million dollar, 20-carat engagement ring, at gunpoint in Oct. 2016; as well as other personal items. The traumatic experience caused Kim longterm emotional struggles, which she still deals with to this day.

However, she’s admitted that the robbery was “meant” to happen to her. “I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,” Kim said through tears on Ellen [April, 2017]. “I know that was so meant to happen to me. I’m such a different person … I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.”

In case [for some reason] you didn’t watch Taylor’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, we can help you decode the whole assumed robbery reference. At one point in the extremely cryptic video, Taylor lays in a bathtub, filled with diamonds.

When Kim was robbed, she said she was attacked in her Paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged.

Kim was robbed at gunpoint.

Later on in the video, Taylor, along with a group of accomplices, all wearing cat masks and hoodies, are seen viciously tearing through a closet, while stuffing money into bags.

When Kim was robbed, she described the scene as French men rummaging through her things, looking for money, jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers.

"George Clooney's $220M Wedding Disaster - Prenup Feud, Guest List Flub & Planner Quit!

George Clooney's upcoming nuptials to fiancee Amal Alamuddin is turning out to be disastrous - a prenup the couple has been arguing over, worries about a guest list feud and their wedding planner quitting - and the couple might not even make it down the aisle!

A new report from The National ENQUIRER claims the Hollywood playboy has been negotiating and ""fighting"" with soon-to-be wife's legal team over a $220 million wedding contract.

""Clooney is worth an estimated $220 million. Given his shaky track record with women over the years, including a difficult divorce from his first wife and the brief longevity of most Hollywood marriages in general, I think he needs to make sure he has a prenuptial agreement that's ironclad,"" divorce attorney Raoul L. Felder told The ENQUIRER.

""He has a lot to worry about and a lot to lose if he doesn't proceed with the utmost care and caution. The fact that (his fiancee) is a lawyer is strike one against him. I expect his lawyers are being very careful and 'fighting' her lawyers over every point.""

Indeed, Alamuddin's intellect and successful career was an attraction for Clooney, but now it may work against him.

Adding tension to the Lake Como ceremony is an old scandal surrounding one of Clooney's best buddies, Brad Pitt - his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston and current partner Angelina Jolie.

""At first she was on the fence about going,"" the source said of Jolie, ""because she's not big on schmoozing at Hollywood get-togethers. But she quickly changed her mind after George told her that President Obama RSVP'd 'Yes'!""

Pitt was going with or without her, the source noted, and Aniston also remains confirmed on the guest list.

""George is extremely concerned that by inviting both these women, they'll undoubtedly try to upstage each other and in doing so take the spotlight off the bride,"" the insider told the magazine.

And the third strike? Their wedding planner quit because of location confusion causing complete disarray.

""Before switching locations, George told the planner he wanted a sponsor,"" the source said.

""Now it all seems disorganized.""

"Pop insiders claim Justin Bieber cancelled long-running tour as he's considering starting his own church

POP insiders sensationally claim Justin Bieber may have cancelled his current long-running tour so he can start up his own CHURCH. Bieber shocked millions of fans yesterday when he revealed he was calling off the Purpose tour months before it was due to end as he was ""burned out."" The Canadian has revealed he wants to get back to his religious roots

He wrote on Facebook that he was was feeling exhausted after 18 long months on the road. However, sources claim Bieber may now be looking at starting up his own church as part of his plan to get closer to God.

""[He’s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he’s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own – starting his own church – we’re not quite sure, but that’s the word from an inside source.”

A statement on the star's Facebook site read: “Due to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts.

One wrote: "" I'm sad, but i understand. I wish nothing but the best for Justin Bieber and hope all is well. I will be at his next tour and will keep him in prayer.""

While another posted: ""I hope you're okay Justin xxx Your health and wellbeing is more important than the tour.

""We beliebers support you no matter what. None of us care so much about the tour at the moment ...we care about you and your team. Well done for all the hard work you and the rest of the crew did over the past 18 months Love you xxx""

Over the last two years, Bieber has admitted he had turned to God as way of getting his life back on the straight and narrow.

In a media interview, the Canadian said that God had come to him when he was lost.

He believed that ""the almighty"" was telling him something.

That was when he decided to change his life for the better and in his own words, ""get his stuff together.""

And just last month, he took a leap of faith off a cliff in New Zealand, symbolically marking a new chapter in his journey with Christ.

Bieber said the name of ""Jesus"" before launching himself off a cliff at New Zealand's famous Shotover Canyon Swing & Canyon Fox nature reserve.

He fell backwards with closed eyes and hands behind his head.

The video of his fall has reached millions of people. He captioned it #airbaptism and #gracefall.

Bieber was raised in a Christian home but fame and millions of dollars at an early age eroded his relationship with God.

He claims all of that changed when he rededicated his life to Christ and got rebaptised in 2017.

Now he uses his music to express his newfound faith, including singing worship songs at his concerts, and posting pictures of him at church on social media.

BAD BOY From drink-drive arrests to egging houses, Bieber's most outrageous antics Justin Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. The star had been drag racing a yellow Lamborghini on a Miami beach street with R&B singer Khalil, who had been driving a red Ferrari. Charges were later dropped in an agreement which required Bieber to, among other things, go to anger management counselling and make a large donation to the “Our Kids” organization. Hours after his lawyer filed a not guilty plea to his drunk-driving charge, Justin Bieber was then charged with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver repeatedly in the back of the head. The alleged assault occurred when the driver collected six people from a Toronto nightclub on 29 December 2013. However criminal charges against Bieber were late withdrawn. Pilots of a private jet taking Justin Bieber and his entourage to the Super Bowl were forced to wear oxygen masks to protect against inhaling marijuana fumes which were filling the plane. NBC news reported that the captain of the plane was so concerned about the abusive behaviour of Bieber and his father towards a flight attendant that he had to move her away from them. Probably the most famous incident, Bieber was sentenced to two years’ probation and five days community service for egging the house of his neighbour, sports-agent Jeff Schwartz. As well as community service Bieber was also ordered to pay almost $90,000 in damages to his neighbour and undergo anger management counselling. Bieber stormed off stage mid-performance in Manchester after demanding that the crowd stop screaming in between his songs. However the singer did later return to finish his set. The pop star is filmed apparently punching a fan in Barcelona. The fan leaned into Bieber’s moving vehicle to touch him and footage shows Bieber seemingly responding by punching the fan in the face",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\194fake.txt

"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Maybe Got Secret-Married Last April

In September, Miley Cyrus told The Sun on Sunday that she and her fiancé Liam Hemsworth had no wedding plans anytime soon. ""I don’t envision marriage,"" she told The Sun on Sunday. ""I’m 24. I hope to get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married]."" (Her mother Tish Cyrus made the same point when asked about a rumored Miley-Liam elopement in June, too.)

But, if this wild rumor from Australia’s NW Magazine is true (via The Sun and The Daily Mail), the lack of wedding plans may just be because Cyrus and Hemsworth already had their wedding. In April. A source told the outlet that ""six months ago, way back in late April,"" the two secretly had ""a very intimate ceremony at their house in Malibu. I'm told only a handful of people were there and they're still the only ones who know."" Hm…

Cyrus was first spotted wearing a wedding band-like ring in July.

She was recently photographed with Hemsworth wearing her band with her engagement ring:

Hemsworth was first photographed with one in August.

But People reports these are just promise rings. ""He [Liam] wears that ring as more of a 'promise' to Miley, but they are not officially married,"" a source told E! in August when Hemsworth's ring first debuted. ""The only thing that is missing is the legal piece of paper. The pair is not focused on planning a wedding at this time. They are more focused on making their love as strong as possible.""

But, given Hemsworth also publicly denied being engaged to Cyrus when Cyrus was probably engaged to him and definitely wearing his engagement ring in April 2016, only those two really know what’s going on.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\137fake.txt

"Ryan Gosling says he gave up smoking after filming The Nice Guys

It's a bad habit that many people struggle to kick.

But Ryan Gosling seems to have found the best way to quit smoking once and for all, and according to him, it actually works.

The 35-year-old actor told Australian radio hosts, Kyle And Jackie O, on Tuesday that he 'smoked himself out' whilst filming The Nice Guys, in which he plays a private investigator Holland March, who is addicted to cigarettes.

Admitting he was a smoker in real life before filming, the father-of-two revealed he has since quit after being turned off by smoking too much.

'I use to, but in this movie I smoked myself out,' he laughed, adding: 'I never want another cigarette again!'

'It really is the greatest way to quit - it's hard to come by - you really have to get a film where you have to smoke all the time, but I highly recommend it if you are trying to quit,' he went on.

As well as smoking a lot for the film, the Hollywood star also revealed he drank a lot too - largely due to the influence of his co-star Russell Crowe.

'In terms of the drinking, I am supposed to be drunk all the time in the film, but it actually worked out because I went out with Russell right before we started shooting, so I was still drunk the entire shoot,' he said.

He went on to add: 'So I never had to play drunk once, I was 'Scooby Doo-py' all day long thanks to him!' he joked.

During the chat, Ryan spoke of the close friendship he formed with the Australian star during filming, and says Russell introduced him to some iconic Aussie traits.

'God bless him he tried to teach me about Rugby,' the actor said.

'He was also pumping me with these Australian ginger beer and vodka while he was trying to teach me,' he added.

Kyle was quick to interject, saying: 'That's not very Australian! I don't think I know anyone who drinks that!'

However, Ryan wasn't having any of it, responding: 'Hey listen to me... If Rusty says it's Australian, it's Australian! You understand?'

The two stars are currently on the promotional trail for The Nice Guys.

Russell plays a contract killer to Ryan's private investigator in the film, with the pair working together to solve the mysterious disappearance of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.

The film is scheduled to hit cinemas in Australia next week.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\141fake.txt

"Jennifer Aniston on the Exact Moment She Had It With the Pregnancy Rumors

In July, Jennifer Aniston powerfully spoke out against the constant tabloid pregnancy rumors about her that have circulated through the years, in an op-ed for Huffington Post. ""For the record, I am not pregnant,"" she wrote in it. ""What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment,' and 'celebrity news.'""

""If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.""

The post went viral-but initially, Aniston wasn't even planning on publishing it. She told Ellen DeGeneres this week that she wrote it at first just for herself. ""You know how we kind of write and don't necessarily send it? Or at least when I was a kid I did that. And yeah, I kind of hit a wall. I was pretty raw at the time, just came back from a vacation. My mother sort of-had sort of?-she passed [away],"" Aniston said.

She and husband Justin Theroux had gone away to the Bahamas in the middle of ""nowhere"". But ""we were mobbed, like a scary kind of mob. Like, I didn't know what was happening. I kept thinking, 'Is Kim Kardashian behind me or something? This is very strange.' And then it turns out that another wonderful photograph, which I've had to sort of live with for the last 10 to 15 years: a picture of me with a bump and a circle around my stomach with an arrow pointing to it. Just in this sort of kind of objectifying way, and I was just fed up with it.""

She then poignantly echoed the point she made in her piece: that women are defined by more than just being mothers:

I think these tabloids, all of us, need to take responsibility on what we ingest into our brains. Just because we are women, we have a uterus, we have a vagina, we have ovaries, we need to like, ""Get to work, lady!"" As opposed to, hello, Freedom Medal. We as women do a lot of incredible things in this world other than just procreate-and not that that is not-but it's like we just get boxed in. They love the narrative, they love the story, they love the ""She's jealous of this person, and she's depressed, and oh my god she's never going to have a..."" Whatever the horrible little headline is, we've just got to break out of that and go whoa, whoa. And women, I have to say, are many of the authors of these horrible articles that are written in these B.S. tabloids. So, we have to stop listening to them, we have to stop buying them because we have to support each other, especially at this time, to love each other, to support, and to be proud of women, of whatever your choice is in life. It's up to us what makes us happy and fulfilled.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\007fake.txt
"Krokodil: how ‘flesh-eating zombie drug’ is causing a global crisis
Desomorphine has been in the news lately. Never heard of it? That’s quite possible. But you may well have heard its street name: “Krokodil.” However you know it, it’s a cheap substitute for heroin that has been widely branded a “flesh-eating zombie drug” – and it’s bad news.

There are two reasons for its horrific reputation, one related to desomorphine itself, and the second to the way the street drug is produced.

Desomorphine was actually first synthesised in 1932. As you would guess from its name, it is a “semi-synthetic” relative of morphine, the natural painkiller derived from opium poppies. Compared with morphine, it has one less double bond and one fewer –OH group (morphine has two, desomorphine has one). That’s significant because the more -OH groups a molecule has, the better it will dissolve in water. Conversely, the fewer –OH groups a molecule has, the more lipid (fat) soluble it will be – and that makes it more likely to cross the blood-brain barrier.

In keeping with this, desomorphine is roughly ten times stronger a painkiller than morphine and its effects are felt sooner. It is also eliminated from the body more quickly. Consequently, while a heroin user’s euphoria may last four hours or more, a Krokodil “high” lasts for two hours at most. This means that more doses are required to sustain the high and that desomorphine has a greater potential to cause addiction, which can manifest within just days.

Indeed, Desomorphine was originally synthesised to create a painkiller with fewer side effects than morphine. But while it did offer greater analgesic power, it fell into disuse because of its particular tendency to cause dependence.

The return of Krokodil
Desomorphine was largely forgotten for years – until circumstances conspired to bring it back into prominence. When the Russian government restricted the movement of heroin from Afghanistan into Russia around 2003, there was a sharp increase in the price of heroin on the street. As a consequence, Russian addicts started looking for cheaper substitutes, including desomorphine.

Read more:  Monkey Dust, Krokodil, Nyaope: why new drug concoctions keep appearing

But we are not talking pharmaceutical-grade desomorphine, but rather a version made in kitchen laboratories. The base ingredient for this version is codeine, another natural painkiller found in poppies, with a structure not too different from morphine. Codeine is readily available – often over the counter – as a milder painkiller than morphine. This is then mixed with a number of other additives to create “Krokodil”.

So how did the name “Krokodil” come about? One theory is that it refers to the scaly green skin it can create around injection sites. Another is that it is a corruption of the name of one of the intermediates in its synthesis, “α-chlorocodide”, which is formed when the codeine reacts with the additive, thionyl chloride. Maybe it is a bit of both.

Either way, while Krokodil use first became prevalent in Russia, leading to a lethal epidemic there, it has now spread to Colombia, the US, and Europe, including the UK.

Devastating consequences
Desomorphine is so cheap, partly because of the availability of codeine but also because making it is relatively straightforward; people attempt it at home without the use of a fully-equipped laboratory.

I won’t describe the process in detail for obvious reasons. Typically, however, the codeine is prepared with readily obtained chemicals, including paint thinner, hydrochloric acid, iodine (from “tincture of iodine” antiseptics) and phosphorus (obtained from matchboxes). The process has a lot in common with the so-called “Nagai” method for making methamphetamine. Addicts often do this using their own kitchens and typically don’t bother to purify the resulting substance, which creates more problems.

Users inject their impure desomorphine – and if they miss the vein may end up with an abscess and dead flesh. Other health effects include gangrene, phlebitis, bone infection and pneumonia, not to mention brain damage. Needle sharing may be responsible for spreading HIV and hepatitis C. Tragically, addicts often die within two to three years.

Many addicts make the drug themselves, starting with codeine.  Shutterstock
Another reason Krokodil can be so destructive is the relatively short period of time the drug spends in the body. In order to prevent the onset of withdrawal symptoms, addicts can end up stuck in a continuous cycle of making and injecting, forsaking food and pretty much everything else in the process.

Krokodil has become a popular drug of abuse because it is cheap and easy to make. Sadly, the downside is much greater, leading to addiction, serious medical complications and death. Just don’t go there.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\10.txt

"Prince William and Kate Middleton Moving Out Of Kensington Palace? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Prince William and Kate Middleton are already thinking about moving out of Kensington Palace. That’s because William doesn’t want his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to grow up behind palace walls. Instead, he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible.

In his interview with British GQ, Prince William said that the most important thing for him is knowing that Prince George and Princess Charlotte will grow up in a happy, stable secure world.

In other words, he doesn’t want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors. And while Prince William and Kate Middleton haven’t fully moved in to Kensington Palace just yet, they are already thinking about their next move. Apparently, London is the last place that William wants to be with Kate and their kids.

Of course, if Prince William and Kate Middleton do end up moving from Kensington Palace, royal observers wouldn’t be surprised. It’s taken them this long to move back to London after having spent the last several years at Anmer Hall. Prince William has made it no secret that he doesn’t want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up.

Ideally, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would love to move back to Anmer Hall. It was a gift given to them by Queen Elizabeth. The property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to run around in all day and night.

But of course for Prince William this won’t be easy. He can try and live a private life as much as he wants to, but at the same time he is the future King of England. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be in the spotlight whether he likes it or not. And as much as he would love to return to Anmer Hall in the future, it might not happen.

All of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in London. That’s why many royal fans believe that sooner or later William will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do.

The Knicks may have lost the game, but that didn't dim Taylor's spirits. The beautiful singer posted a picture on Instagram with model, Karlie Kloss with the caption, ""Karlie and I had the time of our lives at the Knicks game tonight. See you tomorrow bright and early on Good Morning America!""

Taylor sat court-side alongside her good friend as well as actor, Ben Stiller and his adorable young son, Qinlin. The four seemed to be having an absolutely wonderful time cheering and smiling. Meanwhile, just a few rows back, Justin sat and chatted with Rev. Jesse Jackson for most of the game.

Taylor is definitely having a moment right now and starting a new chapter in her life. On Oct. 27, the beauty released her album 1989 to rave reviews and has been discussing how much she is loving her new life in New York City.

"Malia Obama Has Barack And Michelle Worried – Can She Handle Life Alone In New York City?

Malia Obama, 18, is adjusting to her new life outside of the White House and the changes are not easy to handle for her famous parents – former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama.

The young woman is busy mixing up a prestigious internship at the Weinstein & Co. offices in Manhattan and cool nights with friends on the town.

The former first daughter is expected to attend Harvard University in the fall. All seems to be going well, but a negative story about Malia trying to beat up a right-wing journalist, allegedly, of course, has her parents worried.

She was also spotted having a fun time with a young man who was later identified as Rob Franklin.

Those headlines raised a lot of questions in some circles, and the power couple is reportedly not immune to the intense chatter.

Is she mature enough to handle life in this big place? Should they be more present in the life of the teenager at this crucial juncture?

Sources close to the Obamas have started talking to the media and describing the dilemma they are facing when it comes to their oldest child.

An insider spoke to a celebrity news website and stated: “Malia [Obama]‘s parents totally trust her and know she has a good head on her shoulders, but it’s still hard for them to let go.”

The person added: “They understand that she’s spreading her wings, that she’s bound to make some mistakes and they’re okay with that. But as much as they trust her they can’t help but worry about her. She’s living in the big city all alone and in their eyes she’s still a kid.”

Although it is always hard to tell if those so-called insiders really know what they are talking about, however, the statement above appears plausible.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\146fake.txt
"Robots Taking Over the World 

Robots are slowly taking over the workforce of the world.  Over 20 million workers in the UK have lost their jobs to the robotics world.  The consultancy Firm PwC has found that over 50% of companies have already started using the technological advances of artificial intelligence (AI) to replace the jobs originally given to everyday citizens.  Former employees of these companies are at a complete loss.  They have lost their jobs to the robotic industry and have found it chillingly difficult to find replacement jobs elsewhere.  Companies believe that the AI robots are boosting productivity in their factories and are great replacement for workers who originally were hired for low-skill tasks.  PwC says this is just the start of the incorporation of AI in society.  Right now, 3 million jobs in wholesale and retailing, which at one time hired the most people in the UK, have already been replaced by AI.  Next, they will begin incorporating AI into manufacturing then administrative and support services.  Soon, companies will be using AI for 95% of the work within their company.

"Inside Rob K. & Mehgan James' Romance: Why His Fam ''Doesn't Approve''

UPDATE: As new reports continue to surface regarding Rob Kardashian's relationship with Mehgan James, both took to social media to weigh in on the matter.

""Wait reading online about some chick I'm dating Megan something. Not true never even met her or heard of her before,"" he tweeted Thursday.

James retweeted his message and also wrote on Instagram Friday, ""Before any of you start defaming my character .. I'm CLEARLY not dating rob , nor have I ever confirmed that I was . You all just so happen to believe everything you read. I posted one pair of Arthur George socks 2/3 weeks ago & now all of a sudden I'm a home wrecker, a fraud , a hoe... etc.""

""I'm just 'Megan something.' that most of you 'never heard of,'"" she added. ""I don't have that type of power. I was just as confused as anyone else and was told not to even entertain it.""

As reports swirl around a possible romance between the E! reality star and Mehgan James, E! News can confirm the pair are in fact an item and started dating three months ago. As for what makes their relationship work, an insider tells E! News it's the encouragement Rob feels from the Bad Girls Club star that's really moved the blossoming fling in a positive direction.

""Mehgan supports Rob and all of his endeavors, and just wants to help him,"" the source shares. ""They are very much best friends. She just wants to be there for him.""

"Kim Kardashian Jealous Of Kourtney’s Bikini Body: Working Out Twice A Day To Compete

Kim Kardashian is green with envy over her sister’s bangin’ bikini bod. But instead of letting Kourtney Kardashian steal her shine, the OG sex symbol is going  on the attack. Here’s her EXCLUSIVE game plan to take back the spotlight!

With Kim Kardashian West‘s killer curves, you’d think she’d have all the body confidence in the world. But a friend of the reality beauty tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, that Kim, 36, totally envies her sister Kourtney Kardashian‘s super fit physique. “Kim’s extremely jealous of Kourtney’s bikini body, don’t get me wrong she’s proud of her, but she still can’t help feel like she’s losing some sort of competition.” In fairness, the 38-year-old mom of three is pretty much killing the bikini body game right now — who wouldn’t be jealous?

“She and Kourtney have always been this way,” says our source.”When they were kids they would compete over every little thing and not much has changed.” Ah good old fashioned sibling rivalry — does it ever go away?

But, this is more than just a family power struggle, guys. According to Kim’s longtime friend she’s still feeling the aftershocks of the brutal body shaming she endured last month. “Kim is still struggling with what happened on their girls trip, the body shaming she got was horrific and she still hasn’t totally recovered.” Poor Kim, we know that must have been so hard.

Fortunately, Kim has found a way to take charge and she’s working out her feelings in the gym.”She’s trying to use this as motivation. She’s back training hard with Gunnar and she’s still workout of with Don too. She’s very motivated, she wants to get in better shape than Kourtney.” We think Kim looks absolutely amazing exactly as she is — they’re both body goals as far as we’re concerned!

"The Weeknd Was Spotted Holding Hands With Justin Bieber’s Ex

If you’re an avid US Weekly reader, it might appear that there are only about a dozen single people in Hollywood, as they all date each other. It’s like six degrees of separation with Kevin Bacon, only for influencers with a penchant for fit tea and waist trainers, where Scott Disick is the connecting factor.

Here, we prove that theory. After Selena Gomez and the Weeknd dated for about a year, they broke up and she was spotted back with her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber, almost immediately. Now, it looks like the Weeknd wants revenge, and is using his party monster ways to get it. While Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been attending church twice in one day—apparently, the new couple has a lot to repent for—the Weeknd has been parading models around.

The Weeknd was caught canoodling with Bieber’s rumored ex, model Yovanna Ventura. He was even spotted holding hands with the model, which is almost as serious as becoming Instagram official. According to an Us Weekly source who saw The Weeknd in action, “He was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.”

The potential new couple was snapped at a birthday party in Beverly Hills for French Montana (who dated Khloe Kardashian, whose sister Kourtney Kardashian was rumored to have dated Bieber—and to make everything more confusing, The Weeknd previously dated Bella Hadid, a close friend of the Kardashian/Jenner family). It’s all very Degrassi, only Drake is slightly less involved—although he’s rumored to be hooking up with Hadid and feuding with The Weeknd because of it.

The Weeknd and Ventura were also seen leaving Hyde nightclub together in the back of an SUV, much like Leonardo DiCaprio and his model friend, 19-year-old Juliette Perkins. And there’s another Leo link—The Weeknd made sure to stop by Leonardo DiCaprio’s 43rd birthday with model Emily Ratajkowski.

Leo’s birthday was held at the Highlight Room, a rooftop club that opened above the Dream Hollywood hotel in Los Angeles and currently has two stars on Yelp. Of course, there were plenty of models milling about, leaving ample options for The Weeknd—but not all of them had been linked to Bieber in the past.

It looks like Bieber, Gomez and The Weeknd should all start writing for their next break-up albums…or maybe they can all just collaborate on one.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\133fake.txt

"Justin Bieber Vacation: Purpose Tour On Hold After Awards Show Rant? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

It appears that Justin Bieber's Purpose Tour is on hold and Justin is on vacation with friends. Justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow. The vacation photos started popping up on Justin's Instagram on May 25. Looks as if Justin went camping with an assortment of friends. The singer, who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts, wrote, ""These are the nights I live for.""

While taking some time off Justin is jet-skiing, maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out. Justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos. On May 27 Justin posted a selfie on Instagram – he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background.

But what's going on with the Purpose Tour? Checking out Justin's website all previous concert dates have been removed. You can't tell for certain if Justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because he's burned out.

The first signs that Justin Bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a CD doesn't mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like he's your bestie. You buy a CD and that's all you're entitled to, a CD, not a piece of Justin.

Next Justin kind of snapped after the Billboard Music Awards saying all these awards shows are all fake, shallow and meaningless. Yet a few days later Justin profusely thanked the Teen Choice Awards for the three nominations he received. Once again, Justin used Instagram to express himself.

The Purpose Tour resumes on June 11 with several stops in Canada and then through the United States through July 19. After two Tokyo shows in August the tour resumes in Europe in September and runs non-stop through the end of November.

A schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks. Hopefully Justin will get some much needed R&R and put all the controversy behind him when the tour resumes.

The shocking minutes relating to President Putin’s meeting this past week with US Secretary of State John Kerry reveal the Russian leaders “extreme outrage” over the Obama regimes continued protection of global seed and plant bio-genetic giants Syngenta and Monsanto in the face of a growing “bee apocalypse” that the Kremlin warns “will most certainly” lead to world war.
According to these minutes, released in the Kremlin today by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (MNRE), Putin was so incensed over the Obama regime’s refusal to discuss this grave matter that he refused for three hours to even meet with Kerry, who had traveled to Moscow on a scheduled diplomatic mission, but then relented so as to not cause an even greater rift between these two nations.The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) today has issued an “Extreme Danger” warning for all vessels entering or nearing the United States Port of Mobile, located in the State of Alabama, as the death toll rises from what this report claims is an environmental disaster related to the flowering of genetically modified cotton crops located in this region.

"Did Angelina Jolie Fake Maddox Jolie Pitt's Adoption? Inside The Shocking Claims

Angelina Jolie is famous for adopting kids from around the world, but did she obtain her first son, Maddox, using falsified documents? Maddox's real Cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that Jolie doesn't have legal power of attorney over the 15-year-old.

According to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Mounh Sarath says that he has official paperwork from Cambodia that confirms he is Maddox's father. Jolie started Maddox's adoption back in 2002, and Brad Pitt legally adopted him in 2006. But according to Sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager.

Sarath and Jolie have not spoken to each other in years. Even more scandalous, the adoption agent Jolie worked with, Lauryn Galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from Cambodia. At the time Jolie adopted Maddox, the United States had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from Cambodia. Did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws?

The Sun reports that Sarath works in charity and local aid in Cambodia. Given his falling out with Jolie and the circumstances surrounding Maddox's adoption, Sarath's opinion of the Tomb Raider star is pretty low.

""I would be happy if Cambodia didn't see her again,"" he added.

Jolie's interest in Cambodia started when she filmed her 2001 hit film in the country, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. She recently directed a movie based in Cambodia, First They Killed My Father, and has visited the country on several different occasions.

The allegations against Angelina Jolie couldn't have come at a worse time. The actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in Cambodia.

Maddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in Jolie's split with Pitt. Shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that Pitt had physically abused Maddox on a private plane. Pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit.

Things between Maddox and Jolie, meanwhile, couldn't be better. Hollywood Life reports that Jolie took Maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to London. During their stay, Jolie and Maddox ventured off to Buckingham Palace for a mother-son date.

The pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. It isn't clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there's a possibility they mingled with Prince William.

The outing came after Jolie gave a speech at the London School of Economics. Jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. The actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the United Nations in London.

Maddox was the only member of the Jolie-Pitt family that accompanied Jolie to the palace. Earlier last week, Jolie was spotted taking Maddox's siblings out to a toy store in London. The kids have since returned to the United States.

As far as Jolie and Pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. Although they haven't finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out.

Given how their divorce played out in the early months, it's definitely good to hear that Jolie and Pitt are working through their differences. They have not released an official comment on Maddox's adoption.

"Beyonce Gets a Surprise Visit From Hillary Clinton

Hillary Clinton recently paid a visit to the Queen ... Bey, that is!

""Beyonce was filming a video and Hillary made a surprise visit to the set"" on Thursday, March 24, in L.A., a source exclusively reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.

The insider could not reveal if the Democratic front-runner, 68, scored an on-screen cameo, but a second insider confirms Beyonce, 34, is currently working on an album, complete with music videos. (The album is likely to drop in April.)

By the next morning, Clinton had returned to the campaign trail, setting her sights on the goal she laid out in December.



""I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer,"" she said when asked at an Iowa town hall if she'd rather be Beyonce or president.

No doubt securing a permanent spot in the hive, the presidential hopeful had high praise for the pop star at the event: ""You see her on TV, it's impressive; you see her in person, you're just stunned.

"Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was made to disappear so one party could gain control of a multiply-owned patent.


Here’s what you all need to know. Spread this information everywhere:

Four days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office

4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX.

Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders:

Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)
Freescale Semiconductor (20%)

If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will.

If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent.

That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.

Who owns Freescale Semiconductor?

Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone (what an interesting name for a company) who owns Freescale.

Here is your motive for the missing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane, and that patent was the breakthrough.

"Fallen Soldier
Another 4th of July is here and all across the nation, millions of us will celebrate in thousands of different ways.  Our military members around the world will miss out on hometown celebrations, instead, performing the duties assigned to them.  This story is in honor of them.

As a commercial pilot, I too see the effects of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Last month I showed up to start a trip and was approached by a gate agent.  “Captain, good morning, I wanted to inform you that we have H.R. on this flight”, she said.  H.R. stands for human remains.  “Are they military?”, I asked.  “Yes”, she said.  “Is there and escort?”, I asked.  “Yes, I already assigned him a seat”, she said.  “Would you please tell him to come to the flight deck, you can board him early”, I said.

A short while later, a young army sergeant entered the flight deck.  He was the image of the perfectly dressed soldier.  He introduced himself and I asked him about his soldier.  The escorts of these fallen soldiers talk about them as if they are still alive and with us.  “My soldier is on his way back to Virginia”, he said.  He proceeded to answer my questions, but offered no words on his own.  I asked him if there was anything I could do for him and he said no.  I told him that he has the toughest job in the military and that I appreciated the work that he does for the families of our fallen soldiers.  The first officer and I got up out of our seats to shake his hand.  He left the flight deck to find his seat.

We completed our preflight checks, pushed back and performed an uneventful departure.  About 30 minutes into our flight I received a call from the lead flight attendant in the cabin.  “I just found out the family of the soldier we are carrying, is onboard”, he said.  He then proceeded to tell me that the father, mother, wife and 2-year-old daughter were escorting their son, husband, and father home.  The family was upset because they were unable to see the container that the soldier was in before we left.  We were on our way to a major hub at which the family was going to wait 4 hours for the connecting flight home to Virginia. The father of the soldier told the flight attendant that knowing his son was below him in the cargo compartment and being unable to see him was too much for him and the family to bare.  He had asked the flight attendant if there was anything that could be done to allow them to see him upon our arrival.  The family wanted to be outside by the cargo door to watch the soldier being taken off the airplane.  I could hear the desperation in the flight attendants voice when he asked me if there was anything I could do.  “I’m on it”, I said.  I told him that I would get back to him.

Airborne communication with my company normally occurs in the form of email like messages.  I decided to bypass this system and contact my flight dispatcher directly on a secondary radio. There is a radio operator in the operations control center who connects you to the telephone of the dispatcher.  I was in direct contact with the dispatcher.  I explained the situation I had onboard with the family and what it was the family wanted.  He said he understood and that he would get back to me.
Two hours went by and I had not heard from the dispatcher.  We were going to get busy soon and I needed to know what to tell the family.  I sent a text message asking for an update.  I saved the return message from the dispatcher and this following is the text.

“Captain, sorry it has taken so long to get back to you.  There is policy on this now and I had to check on a few things.  Upon your arrival a dedicated escort team will meet the aircraft.  The team will escort the family to the ramp and planeside.  A van will be used to load the remains with a secondary van for the family.  The family will be taken to their departure area and escorted into the terminal where the remains can be seen on the ramp.  It is a private area for the family only.  When the connecting aircraft arrives, the family will be escorted onto the ramp and planeside to watch the remains being loaded for the final leg home.  Captain, most of us here in flight control are veterans.  Please pass our condolences on to the family, thanks.”

I sent a message back telling flight control thanks for a good job.  I printed out the message and gave it to the lead flight attendant to pass on to the father.  The lead flight attendant was very thankful and told me, “You have no idea how much this will mean to them.”  Things started getting busy for the descent, approach and landing. 

After landing, we cleared the runway and taxied to the ramp area.  The ramp is huge with 15 gates on either side of the alleyway.  It is always a busy area with aircraft maneuvering every which way to enter and exit.  When we entered the ramp and checked in with the ramp controller, we were told that all traffic was being held for us.  “There is a team in place to meet the aircraft”, we were told.  It looked like it was all coming together, then I realized that once we turned the seat belt sign off, everyone would stand up at once and delay the family from getting off the airplane.  As we approached our gate, I asked the copilot to tell the ramp controller we were going to stop short of the gate to make an announcement to the passengers.  He did that and the ramp controller said, “Take your time.” 

I stopped the aircraft and set the parking brake.  I pushed the public address button and said, “Ladies and gentleman, this is your captain speaking.  I have stopped short of our gate to make a special announcement.  We have a passenger on board who deserves our honor and respect.  His name is private XXXXXX, a soldier who recently lost his life.  Private XXXXXX is under your feet in the cargo hold.  Escorting him today is army sergeant XXXXXXX.  Also onboard are his father, mother, wife, and daughter.  Your entire flight crew is asking for all passengers to remain in their seats to allow the family to exit the aircraft first.  Thank you.”

We continued the turn to the gate, came to a stop and started our shutdown procedures.  A couple of minutes later I opened the cockpit door.  I found the two forward flight attendants crying, something you just do not see.  I was told that after we came to a stop, every passenger on the aircraft stayed in their seats, waiting for the family to exit the aircraft.  When the family got up and gathered their things, a passenger slowly started to clap their hands.  Moments later more passengers joined in and soon the entire aircraft was clapping.  Words of “God Bless You, I’m sorry, Thank you, Be proud, and other kind words were uttered to the family as they made their way down the aisle and out of the airplane.  They were escorted down to the ramp to finally be with the loved one lost. 

I never did see the family.  Another soldier died, another family grieved and we did what we could.  That is the way it works sometimes.  I get a call from the cabin and we work as a team to do what we can.  That day everybody from the flight crew, to the operations center, to the 184 passengers onboard, we did what we could.  Many of the passengers disembarking thanked me for the announcement I made.  They were just words, I could say them over and over again, but nothing I say will bring that soldier back.  I respectfully ask that all of you reflect on this day and the sacrifices that millions of men and women have made to ensure our freedom, safety, and the right to live a good life.

Be safe,

"First World War officially ends 
 The final payment of £59.5 million, writes off the crippling debt that was the price for one world war and laid the foundations for another.

Germany was forced to pay the reparations at the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 as compensation to the war-ravaged nations of Belgium and France and to pay the Allies some of the costs of waging what was then the bloodiest conflict in history, leaving nearly ten million soldiers dead.

The initial sum agreed upon for war damages in 1919 was 226 billion Reichsmarks, a sum later reduced to 132 billion, £22 billion at the time.

The bill would have been settled much earlier had Adolf Hitler not reneged on reparations during his reign.

Hatred of the settlement agreed at Versailles, which crippled Germany as it tried to shape itself into a democracy following armistice, was of significant importance in propelling the Nazis to power.
""On Sunday the last bill is due and the First World War finally, financially at least, terminates for Germany,"" said Bild, the country's biggest selling newspaper.

Most of the money goes to private individuals, pension funds and corporations holding debenture bonds as agreed under the Treaty of Versailles, where Germany was made to sign the 'war guilt' clause, accepting blame for the war.

France, which had been ravaged by the war, pushed hardest for the steepest possible fiscal punishment for Germany.

The principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, John Maynard Keynes, resigned in June 1919 in protest at the scale of the demands.

""Germany will not be able to formulate correct policy if it cannot finance itself,' he warned.

When the Wall Street Crash came in 1929, the Weimar Republic spiralled into debt. Four years later, Hitler was elected Chancellor of Germany.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\41.txt

ROCKLAND — 14-year-old Amanda Peters hid her pregnancy from her mother for nearly three months until she began to show. When her mother Judy confronted her, Amanda denied having sexual intercourse and was taken immediately to a doctor who concluded she had likely been sexually active.

That’s when Amanda’s mother begged God to forgive her sinful daughter. However, her prayers were met strangely:  Judy claims God came to her in a vision and said he had impregnated Amanda through immaculate conception and that she was to give birth to Jesus.

“At first I was confused, ” Mrs. Peters said. “Jesus was born to the Virgin Mary thousands of years ago, why was Amanda going to give birth to him again? But God explained this was how Jesus was to return to Earth as promised.”

Judy told her daughter who was overjoyed that she was no longer grounded and had regained her phone privileges.

“Things are the double bomb right now,” Amanda said. “My mom’s totally supportive and buying me lots of cool stuff I want and said she is going to pay for everything Jesus needs.”

"Rupaul claims Trump touched him inappropriately in the 1990s

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr Trump ""made a move"" on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.

The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman.

Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity.

This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump.

Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years.

The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps's alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered.

All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from 2005 obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News.

The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show ""Access Hollywood.""

The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation.

He added: ""Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""

"TACO BELL MEAT
MONTGOMERY, AL – After allegations of false advertising, further investigation causes Taco Bell to close its doors for good.

Taco Bell, the pseudo Mexican restaurant popular among college students, poor people, those without taste buds, and individuals with bad taste in general,  has recently been put on the stand for allegations regarding false advertisement.

On Friday, the law firm of Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis, Miles and another partner whose name no one can spell or pronounce, filed a law suit against the Mexican wannabe claiming that the meat mixture contains too many fillers and binders to be labeled as beef.

The majority of the time the meat mix is doused with so much cheese, salsa, and sour cream it is a wonder that anyone could tell it was beef flavored, much less question the authenticity of the meat itself.

Weekly Would News knew that these allegations could only be just the tip of the iceberg so we sent our crack team of reporters to the streets to find out what else could be behind these allegations.

It did not take long for our team to discover that the meat that Taco Bell uses for its beef based products is imported from China. This set off a myriad of bells and whistles on our end so we asked our Japanese WWN affiliates to check out the Kuang Ren factory in the Zhejiang province where the beef is packaged. Within hours our Japanese colleagues were back in touch with a shocking discovery, the so called beef is actually cat and dog meat.

We all know that that the Chinese have been known to eat cat and dog meat but we never thought that they would have the cajones to import the goods to the US. Taco Bell would not return our phone calls, which leads us to believe that this must be true.

Upon the discovery of the news, we immediately did the right thing and informed the FDA. The FDA has since mandated that all Taco Bells must be closed forever. So go get as many doggy burritos and kitty fajitas as you can before they are gone for good.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\40.txt

"Phone device tests male fertility with 98% accuracy, study shows


A new smartphone attachment can evaluate a man's semen and determine his level of fertility with up to 98% accuracy, a new study has showed.

The new technology -- consisting of an external accessory in which sperm samples are inserted and an app that analyzes them -- could make testing as straightforward as a home pregnancy test, the scientists say. The new technology is still a few years away, but the team behind it hopes this new form of testing will make infertility testing both easier and cheaper for men, avoiding the need for them to go to a clinic.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\tech020.legit.txt

"Is Ryan Seacrest Quitting 'Live'?

Ryan Seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in New York City. The talk show and radio host is renting a place in Manhattan so that he can be in the Big Apple during the week in order to host Live! with Kelly Ripa each morning. However, a new report from Radar Online claims that Seacrest — who had previously been living in Los Angeles — is “miserable” on the East Coast.

“Ryan is miserable. [Moving was] the biggest mistake of his life. He hasn’t embraced the city and hasn’t been going out to the restaurants or parties. He’s invited to almost every event every night and doesn’t go! He’s such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much. He can’t wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved LA,” a source told the popular gossip site.

Although Radar Online doesn’t name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time, this one has some people convinced. It seems more than obvious that Seacrest loved living in Los Angeles and he travels to the West Coast so frequently that one could assume he’s unhappy in New York. He has been rooted in California for years and is used to a different way of life. Moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone, let alone someone famous who has loved that LA lifestyle for so long.

This new report coincides with constant rumors that Seacrest and his Live! co-host, Kelly Ripa, aren’t getting along. Although the two have been pals for many years, sources have said that they are at each other’s throats and that their on-air chemistry (which some fans wouldn’t argue doesn’t even exist) ends the moment the cameras stop rolling.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, ratings on Live! have dipped since the announcement that Seacrest was the new co-host. However, that dip was almost to be expected, given the hype built up around the announcement, which had been building for a whole year. However, sources have said that Seacrest wasn’t Ripa’s first choice — and maybe not even her second choice. For fans of Live!, Seacrest wasn’t even in their top five (favorite contenders included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Fred Savage, Jerry O’Connell, and even Kelly’s husband, Mark Consuelos).

So, if any of these rumors are true, will Seacrest end up leaving Live!? It is definitely a possibility. However, the gig hasn’t seemed right for Seacrest since his name was announced on Monday, May 1. Some fans feel that he wasn’t the best choice to be Ripa’s co-host — and maybe that’s going to turn out to be true.

There are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that Seacrest is going to leave Live! in 2018. It is entirely possible that he will want to move back to Los Angeles — and that he may ink a deal to host the new American Idol. That gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him.

Details of Seacrest’s contract with Live! are unknown. He may have signed a one-year deal or he may have signed a multi-year deal. However, there are always ways for someone to get around something if they aren’t happy or it’s not working.

Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson are'nt in good terms and the movie's sequel, Fifty Shades Freed is facing cancellation threats.  According to Chattsports,  Dornan is busy with a new movie.

Excited fans are disappointed that the sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey might be postponed to a later date. According to the reporte, Dornan was furious with Johnson's actions on set. However, there is no reported information on what the actual reason was. The article reportedly stated that the feud started during the filming of the movie.

Meanwhile, Untogether will reportedly feature the life of a drug addict, and Dornan will play the role of a writer. The production team reportedly did not confirm anything yet and the rumours were debunked because of lack of factual details.

"Selena Gomez And The Weeknd Engaged, Planning For Summer 2017 Wedding?

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are reportedly ""getting married"" in August 2017.

According to a new report, Selena Gomez and her singer boyfriend, who are currently enjoying time together in Buenos Aires, are allegedly planning to make their relationship official after he wraps his Starboy: Legend of the Fall 2017 World Tour in August.

""[Selena Gomez] knows The Weeknd is her soul mate and doesn't want to spend years waiting to get married,"" a source told In Touch Weekly for their April 10 issue, via Hollywood Life.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have only been dating publicly for a few months, but according to the report, Gomez is moving forward full steam when it comes to planning their alleged wedding.

""[Selena Gomez] already has a wedding dress in mind,"" the source explained. ""She wants something classic; white, long and fitted to show off her amazing body. She's yet to choose a designer, but Versace, Giorgio Armani and Marchesa are at the top of her list.""

The In Touch Weekly insider claimed Selena Gomez and The Weeknd had several locations in mind for their potential wedding, including Lake Como in Italy, Venice, Florence and Paris. As fans may recall, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd embarked on a tour of Italy weeks after they confirmed their relationship with a joint outing in Los Angeles.

As for who may be in attendance at Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's allegedly upcoming nuptials, the magazine's insider claimed the pair was planning to keep things intimate.

""[Selena Gomez] and The Weeknd plan to only invite family and a few close friends,"" the source shared. ""Selena's cousin Priscilla DeLeon will be the maid of honor and her little sister, Gracie Teefey, will be a flower girl. It's going to be very small.""

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have both been involved in highly publicized relationships in the past, and their own relationship is no different. After going public in January, the couple was seen spending time together in Los Angeles with French Montana and Jaden Smith, and a short time later, it was off to Italy where they were seen sightseeing in Venice and Florence.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd also spent time in Europe in late February and early March as The Weeknd's tour stopped in several cities, including Amsterdam and Paris, and they later traveled to Toronto before their arrival in Argentina days ago.

Although Selena Gomez and The Weeknd haven't confirmed an engagement or plans to wed, a second source recently spoke out about their relationship and revealed that they are quite serious about their future.

""It's serious, very serious,"" an insider told Hollywood Life. ""The Weeknd has already told [Selena Gomez] that he loves her and vice versa. He speaks a couple of languages and has made sure to confess his love in English, French, Spanish and Amharic.""

""Whenever they travel to a new country, he tells her he loves her in that language,"" the source continued. ""He doesn't speak Portuguese, but learned how to say I love you [in the language]. Selena of course loves how romantic he is and melts every time he says those three little words, or two, depending on the language.""

Prior to her relationship with The Weeknd, Selena Gomez was involved in an on-and-off relationship with Justin Bieber, and when the ""Cold Water"" singer discovered news of the relationship, he wasn't happy.

"Kevin Hart Begs Wife Eniko Parrish For Forgiveness With $250000 Push Gift

Kevin Hart is telling himself — nothing says “I am sorry for cheating and humiliating you” like a $250,000 gift.

If the latest rumors are accurate, Hart feels bad for his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, after getting caught in a sex scandal with stripper and singer Montia Sabbag and is, therefore, willing to spend a small fortune on a lavish baby shower and a push present.

A friend of the comedian told a popular publication that he is going to shower the woman carrying his baby with diamonds to show how committed he is to their marriage.

The person told the media outlet: “Kevin [Hart] is planning the ultimate push present to give to his wife, Eniko [Parrish]. He has not picked it out yet, but he has decided that it is going to be very expensive and have lots of diamonds. He wants this present to be a symbol of his love and commitment to Eniko and their new baby. Kevin asked his assistant to help pick out a super bling ring, necklace, or something classy out for Eniko in the $250k price range. Kevin is determined to prove to Eniko that he loves her and wants their relationship to last.”

Another insider claimed that Hart has nothing to worry about because while his wife is hurt, she is deep in the third trimester, and has no plans to raise a baby alone.

The source explained: “Eniko is hurt and angry, but she is nowhere near ready to walk away. She simply can‘t imagine her life without Kevin. He is her world, and it has been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.”

The pal shared that Parrish is focused living a stress-free life and having a healthy baby.

The friend revealed: “Leaving him is not even a question, she is in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her child’s needs come first.

"Jim Carrey Claims Donald Trump Is A 'Reptilian-Illuminati Blood Prince'

Jim Carrey has told fans and supporters that Donald Trump is not human but is a “reptilian that shapeshifts between human and reptile form” and he has witnessed the president shapeshift “in the flesh, before my very eyes, and in my opinion, as personal warning to me.“

Speaking to supporters at the Signature Gallery in Las Vegas where he is hosting his first ever art exhibition, “Sunshower”, the beloved comedic actor dropped hints about the themes buried deep in his paintings.

“I am interested in what is behind the veil of reality, the real power structures that control the universe. I’m no longer interested in the daily facade. I’ve put everything I know into these paintings.”

Carrey first met Donald Trump at a boxing match held at the Trump Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City in the early 90s. A popular TV actor at the time, Carrey was criticized by Trump’s associates for “failing to entertain” the future president.

But according to Carrey, he was “avoiding him like the plague” because he witnessed Trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue.

“Donald Trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,” Carrey said.

Explaining that Donald Trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form “at least three times” while greeting him, Carrey claims that he also saw Trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests.

“His hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable. When he smiled his teeth changed into razor sharp reptile teeth and glistened like jewel-encrusted daggers.”

“It wasn’t just me. I’m not going to name names, but these secrets are well known in certain circles, among those in the know.“

Carrey says he believes Trump shapeshifted while greeting him as a show of strength and a warning not to mess with the dominant reptilian-political Illuminati of which he is a “blood prince.”

“This branch of the Illuminati, the most powerful branch, they come from Bavaria,” Carrey said, explaining that “Bavaria is Trump’s ancestral homeland.”

Asked if he had proof of his claims, Carrey told his supporters to “watch what happens when these issues get raised in the media. The gatekeepers will try to deny I said these things. When that doesn’t work, they will try and destroy my reputation.”

Carrey also told his fans and supporters to “look deeply” at his artworks to “decipher their real meaning.”

“There are some things you can’t say, but you can paint. I have put everything I know into those paintings.“

“It’s 1am, I’m eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends. I’ve never felt more at peace,” Carrey said.

Carrey’s first hand experiences with the reptilian-Illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts.  I have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over 80 countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing ‘people’ briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes.

I’ve been told this by Californian news anchors, Ethiopian goatherds, and Australian Aboriginals, just to name a few.  A Danish taxi driver described driving past a group of VIP guests at the 2014 Bilderberg meeting in Copenhagen and seeing some of their faces turn reptilian and some of their hands and feet take on a reptilian look.

In Peru a respected psychic told me she sees people in power, like Obama, David Cameron and Hillary Clinton, turn into reptiles whenever she watches an international news channel.

The world’s ruling class have tyrannical control over the mainstream media, as well as our food, water, and air supply, and they are actively dumbing down the masses.  The evidence against them, ancient and modern, is enormous and continuing to grow.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\179fake.txt
"Marines Probe Apparent Slaying of Wounded Iraqi
Marine commanders in Iraq are investigating an incident in which a Marine apparently shot and killed a severely wounded and unarmed Iraqi in a mosque in Fallujah, a Pentagon official said last night.

Images of the incident, captured Saturday on videotape by Kevin Sites, a freelance correspondent working for NBC News who is embedded with a Marine unit, were broadcast last night on several news networks. The videotape shows a squad of Marines entering the building and seeing several Iraqis lying against a wall, either dead or gravely wounded. One Marine shouts something about one Iraqi feigning death. The Marine then shoots the man in the head.

_____MSNBC Video_____ 
 MSNBC icon • A U.S. Marine is under investigation for allegedly fatally shooting an unarmed Iraqi in a Fallujah mosque. 

_____Message Boards_____
• Post Your Comments 
The networks did not broadcast the entire tape, saying some of it was too graphic. ""NBC has chosen not to air the most gruesome of the images,"" NBC anchorman Brian Williams said in introducing the videotape.

According to Sites, the wounded men were insurgents who had battled a different group of Marines the day before. In that firefight, 10 Iraqi fighters were killed and five were wounded. Those five were treated with field bandages and left in the mosque because the conditions of combat did not allow the Marines to bring them out. Other Marines were supposed to collect the wounded Iraqis and take them for treatment, but, for reasons not yet known, that did not happen, Sites said.

Then, on Saturday, the Marines received a report that the area, which they thought had been cleared, had been reoccupied by insurgents, Sites said. A different squad of Marines that had not been involved in the previous day's encounter was sent to investigate. It entered the mosque and saw the men lying on the floor. It was then that the shooting occurred, according to the videotape.

The Marine who shot the wounded Iraqi had been wounded the day before but returned to duty. Since the incident he has been taken out of front-line duty, Sites said.

""My understanding is that the Marines have launched an inquiry into it,"" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. He warned against overreacting to the videotape: ""I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. We don't know all the facts here.""

The Marine investigation was begun yesterday by the staff of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, of which the major ground unit is the 1st Marine Division, Whitman said. He said he did not know the unit involved, but Sites is embedded with the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Marine Division, according to his Web site, www.kevinsites.net.

Lt. Gen. John F. Sattler, commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, in Fallujah, confirmed that an investigation was underway and added: Let me make it perfectly clear: We follow the law of armed conflict. We hold ourselves to a high standard of accountability. The facts of this case will be thoroughly pursued.""

Thomas Lee, a former Navy officer who now teaches at Fordham University School of Law in New York, said that since 1864, the Geneva Conventions governing the law of war have prohibited the killing of wounded or sick enemy combatants.

The situation in the videotape appears to resemble an incident in Kufa, south of Baghdad, in the spring that resulted in the Army bringing charges of murder and dereliction of duty against an officer in the 1st Armored Division.

In that May 21 incident, Capt. Rogelio M. Maynulet shot the wounded driver for militant Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr. Maynulet then told a fellow officer that the man was so badly wounded, with part of his skull blown away, that he shot him out of compassion, according to a military legal proceeding held in Germany in September.

Several other Army soldiers in Iraq have been charged with murder, manslaughter and other offenses in connection with the treatment of detainees or curfew breakers. Also, four soldiers in the 1st Cavalry Division have been charged with premeditated murder of Iraqi civilians.

Retired Army Col. Andrew Bacevich said that such incidents can only damage the U.S. cause in Iraq. ""We cannot prevail in this conflict if our actions suggest that we do not value Muslim life or that we view Muslims as an inferior species,"" said Bacevich, who now teaches international relations at Boston University. ""My sense is that such an impression has already taken hold in the Arab world. This incident can only reinforce that impression.""

"Crucified Ronald McDonald Sculpture 'McJesus' Sparks Protests In Israel
By Carol Kuruvilla, HuffPost US
An Israel art museum’s exhibition featuring a crucified Ronald McDonald is receiving backlash from local Christians ― while the sculpture’s creator wants it taken down for a completely different reason. 

Finnish artist Jani Leinonen’s sculpture, titled, “McJesus,” portrays the fast-food chain McDonald’s clown mascot hanging on a cross, his body positioned in a way that evokes traditional images of Jesus Christ on a cross. It was reportedly meant to serve as commentary on the entanglement of “religious systems and the consumer culture,” according to the Haifa Museum of Art in Israel, where it is currently on display as part of an exhibition titled “Sacred Goods.” 
But some members of Israel’s Arab Christian minority see the sculpture as a disrespectful parody of their faith.  

“We need to understand that freedom of expression is interpreted in different ways in different societies,” Wadie Abu Nassar, an adviser to church leaders in Israel told the Associated Press. “If this work was directed against non-Christians, the world would be turned upside down.”

Protesters gathered outside the Haifa Museum of Art last week to demand the sculpture’s removal. Israeli police told the AP that some protesters threw stones that injured three officers. Police reportedly fired tear gas at people and used stun grenades. 
On Monday, representatives for Christian churches in the region appeared at a district court to lodge complaints about the exhibition. They are seeking a court order to have the sculpture removed, the Times of Israel reported. 

A Catholic leader in Haifa told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that his church condemns violent protests around the artwork and supports the artist’s critique of capitalism — but not through the defacement of the crucifix.

“We denounce the exhibition and the injury to the holiest symbol of Christianity by an institution that is supposed to serve citizens of all religions,” the Rev. Archimandrite Agapious Abu Sa’ada of Haifa’s Saint Elijah Cathedral told Haaretz.

The 40-year-old artist behind the sculpture is also demanding its removal. Leinonen told the Israeli broadcaster Keshet on Sunday that he had joined the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), a campaign that seeks to get Israel to change its policies towards the Palestinians. Supporters of the controversial movement say it is meant to peacefully promote Palestinian political and civil rights by pressuring Israel into ending its occupation of the West Bank, granting Palestinian citizens of Israel full equality under the law, and giving Palestinian refugees a right of return. Opponents say BDS is an anti-Semitic effort to delegitimize Israel.

Leinonen said he asked the Haifa Museum of Art to remove the artwork from its exhibition and was surprised to hear that it was still up. 

“That annoyed me very much since the exhibit is displayed in the exhibition against my will,” he told Keshet, according to a translation by The Times of Israel.

The Haifa Museum told Keshet that the McJesus sculpture was borrowed from a Finnish gallery as part of a contract and that it hasn’t received a request to remove it, the Times of Israel reported.

Leinonen has also created alternative crucifixes that feature the Trix cereal’s rabbit mascot, Kellogg’s Corn Flakes’ Cornelius Rooster, and the maid that appears on boxes of a Finnish cereal brand.

In addition to the McJesus sculpture, the “Sacred Goods” exhibit also features artwork depicting a crucified Jesus carrying shopping bags and wearing sneakers, and a “Ken Jesus Christ” ― a piece that reimagines Christ as a smiling Barbie doll.

The museum’s director Nissim Tal said the exhibit has been on display for several months without incident. The backlash bubbled up after some of the artwork was shared on social media, the AP reported.

Tal told the AP the museum doesn’t plan to take the McJesus statue down. In response to the protests, the museum placed a curtain over the exhibit’s entrance that blocks it from general view and posted a sign warning visitors about potentially offensive content.

“This is the maximum that we can do,” Tal said. “If we take the art down, the next day we’ll have politicians demanding we take other things down, and we’ll end up only with colorful pictures of flowers in the museum.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\24.txt
"Kelly Ripa and Megyn Kelly in a Ratings Battle Over 'Megyn Kelly Today' and 'Live With Kelly and Ryan'

Things are getting heated! Megyn Kelly Today and Live With Kelly and Ryan air during the same time slot (weekdays at 9 a.m.), so it's no surprise there's a ratings battle going on between hosts Megyn Kelly and Kelly Ripa right now!

According to Life & Style, the shows were neck and neck with numbers during Megyn's first day in late September. At that time, Megyn very closely beat Kelly and Ryan by 172,000 viewers (2.932 million vs. 2.760 million). The best part for Megyn? She outnumbered them in the prime age demo: 25 to 54.

However, after a few bad interviews (who could ever forget the Jane Fonda and Will & Grace cast mishap), Megyn's ratings have gone down by 14 percent, which means Kelly and Ryan have taken the lead back. And the Today execs are totally not happy about it. ""Megyn just doesn't come across to the viewers as authentic,"" a network inside told Life & Style.

Things have been difficult for Megyn since her NBC debut. At this point, she's even having trouble getting A-listers to appear on her show. ""Megyn hasn’t been able to book any big-name stars that haven’t been on Today during the first two hours,"" a source told In Touch. ""Hollywood hasn't exactly put the welcome mat out for her. Megyn has left a lot of people cold.""

"Australia to introduce rules about sedating or restraining nursing home residents
On the eve of the royal commission into the aged care sector’s first hearing, the Morrison government has flagged new regulations on the use of chemical and physical restraints in nursing homes.

There are no rules in Australia governing the use of restraints in aged care facilities, unlike the US, Britain and Europe.

The aged care minister, Ken Wyatt, said he was disturbed by footage on the ABC’s 7.30 on Wednesday night, which showed a New South Wales dementia patient docile after being given sedatives without his family’s permission. He had also spent 14 hours strapped to a chair. There was footage of another elderly man physically restrained, bunny hopping across the room.

“That is unacceptable in this day and age and I’m not prepared to allow that to occur and nor is our government,” Wyatt told reporters in Perth.

“Today I’ve asked my department to prepare regulations that will protect senior Australians within residential care.”

He asked his department to pick up the pace on the issue and insisted there had been joint work going on with the Attorney General’s Department.

Asked about a time frame Wyatt said: “It’ll be within weeks at the most.”

Wyatt insisted the media reporting was not what prompted him to act quickly.

“If we neglect a child or we neglect an animal, there are penalties,” he said. “If we neglect a senior Australian, there is no measure other than state and territory legislation. One of the complexities of doing this is having to work with states and territories.”

There are some concerns the controversial practice of doping aged care residents with medication is being used to make up for a shortfall in staff.

The royal commission’s first hearing is scheduled for Adelaide on Friday and commissioners Richard Tracey and Lynelle Briggs will outline their vision for how the inquiry will operate.

Their main task is to examine evidence of substandard aged care, abuse, systematic failures and draw up recommendations for improvement.

The commission will hold hearings in February and March in Adelaide before travelling across Australian cities and regional hubs.

The commission’s final report deadline is 30 April 2020.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\49.txt
"Instagram is removing fake followers, likes, comments from accounts
San Francisco: Instagram on Monday said it is booting fake followers, likes and comments generated by applications tailored to make accounts appear more popular than they actually are.

The crackdown comes as Instagram parent Facebook strives to assure people that the leading social network and its services can be trusted.

“Recently, we’ve seen accounts use third-party apps to artificially grow their audience,” Instagram said in a blog post.

“Starting today, we will begin removing inauthentic likes, follows and comments from accounts that use third-party apps to boost their popularity.”

Instagram is using self-improving software programs to help identify accounts that use such apps and purge products of inauthentic activity, which violates terms of service at the service.

Instagram said it would notify users about removed likes, follows, or comments.

People who unknowingly linked to an offending app need only change passwords to sever connections, according to the photo and video sharing social network.

Instagram users who continue to use such third-party apps possibly seeing their “experience impacted,” but the service did not specify in what ways.

The announcement comes amid growing concerns about Facebook’s efforts to curb misinformation and manipulation.

Facebook has faced renewed criticism following a New York Times investigation suggesting it ignored warnings about Russian influence campaigns on its platform and then used a consulting firm to discredit critics of the social network.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\43.txt
"GRANBO'
Gun-toting granny shoots 2 rapists' testicles off
MELBOURNE, Australia -- Gun-toting granny Ava Estelle, 81, was so ticked-off
when two thugs raped her 18-year-old granddaughter that she tracked the
unsuspecting ex-cons down - - and shot their testicles off!

""The old lady spent a week hunting those bums down -- and when she found
them, she took revenge on them in her own special way,"" said admiring
Melbourne police investigator Evan Delp.

""Then she took a taxi to the nearest police station, laid the gun on the
sergeant's desk and told him as calm as could be: 'Those bastards will never
rape anybody again, by God.'
81-year-old Ava Estelle shows how she turned two rapists into sopranos.

Cops say convicted rapist and robber Davis Furth, 33, lost both his penis
and his testicles when outraged Ava opened fire with a 9-mm pistol in the
seedy hotel room where he and former prison cellmate Stanley Thomas, 29,
were holed up.

The wrinkled avenger also blew Thomas' testicles to kingdom come, but
doctors managed to save his mangled penis, policy said.

""The one guy, Thomas, didn't lose his manhood, but the doctor I talked to
said he won't be using it the way he used to,"" Detective Delp told
reporters. ""Both men are still in pretty bad shape, but I think they're just
happy to be alive after what they've been through.""

The Rambo Granny swung into action August 21 after her granddaughter Debbie
was carjacked and raped by two knife-wielding creeps in a section of town
bordering on skid row.

""When I saw the look on my Debbie's face that night in the hospital, I
decided I was going to go out and get those bastards myself 'cause I figured
the police would go easy on them,"" recalled the retired library worker. ""And
I wasn't scared of them, either -- because I've got me a gun and I've been
shootin' it all my life.""

So, using a police artist's sketch of the suspects and Debbie's description
of the sickos' car, tough-as-nails Ava spent seven days prowling the
wino-infested neighborhood where the crime took place till she spotted the
ill-fated rapists entering their flophouse hotel.

""I know it was them the minute I saw 'em, but I shot a picture of 'em anyway
and took it back to Debbie and she said sure as hell, it was them,"" the
ornery oldster recalled.

""So I went back to that hotel and found their room and knocked on the
door -- and the minute the big one, Furth, opened the door, I shot 'em got
right square between the legs, right where it would really hurt 'em most,
you know. Then I went down to the police station and turned myself in.""

Now, baffled lawmen are tying to figure out how to deal with the vigilante
granny. ""What she did was wrong, but you can't really throw an 81-year-old
woman in prison."" Det. Delp said, ""especially when all 3 million people in
the city want to nominate her for sainthood.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\15.txt

"'Jealous' Kim Tries To Steal Beyonce's Baby Spotlight

While the Bey Hive was buzzing yesterday about Beyonce's shocking baby news, RadarOnline.com has learned that Kim Kardashian was busy with her own plan to steal back the spotlight!

""Kim was shocked at the Beyonce news and she was totally checking it out and seeing how many people like the post,"" an insider told Radar. ""Then when her friend Chrissy Teigen started Tweeting that she was best friends with Beyonce, she was actually hurt and worried.""

As Radar has reported, there is a longstanding rivalry between Queen Bey and Kardashian, 36, and according to an insider, Kardashian is not letting it go anytime soon!

""That's why she started Tweeting,"" the source told Radar. ""She thinks she's a bigger star than Beyonce. She is the biggest star in the world."" And it was time to remind her fans.

The first attempt came right after Beyonce announced the news. Kardashian took to her Twitter to share with her fans that she had finally updated her app, Kim Kardashian Hollywood!

""Had to change up my look in #KimKardashianGame! Have you guys seen the latest update? @KKHOfficial,"" Kardashian wrote on Twitter.

Seeing that had not done anything to put a dent in Beyonce's big news, the KUWTK wife of Yeezy rapper, Kanye West, tried yet again – by announcing that she and pal, Chrissy Tiegen, were starting their own book club.

""So guys..... @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club!,"" Kardashian posted. Sadly, no massive celebrations erupted like she was hoping.

But that's not all! Earlier in the day, Kardashian misled fans to believe that she and West, 39, were ALSO expecting another child together. When a fan asked it it were true, however, Kardashian quickly shot it down.

""While everyone was tweeting and sending congratulations to Beyonce and Jay Z, Kim and Kanye did not say one word about it on their social media,"" the source told Radar.

""The fact that Beyonce is going to have more kids than Kim once her twins are born absolutely drives Kim nuts!""

""Kim was totally trying to steal Beyonce's baby thunder yesterday.""

As Radar reported, Kardashian and West – like Beyonce and Jay Z – hit several rough patches in their superstar union this year, leading many to believe that the two were headed for a messy divorce.

But it seems that one sure-fire way to get over a slump is by getting another baby bump!

""Kim is going to try harder than ever right now to get pregnant because she is constantly searching for a way to one up Beyonce,"" the insider claimed. ""She seems so jealous that Beyonce is more famous than she is. It doesn't seem like Kim will ever, be okay with that.""

For a long time, we have noticed that the decor at the White House has changed since BHO moved in.

It has Arabic symbols on it and has been there from the beginning.

""A long-running squabble between Denmark and Germany over power cables linking the countries has improved the amount of electricity Nordic producers can supply to Europe's biggest market to the greatest level in 17 years. Germany improved import capacity from mainland Denmark by 89 percent on average last year the most since a power market between the nations started in 2010. It's a consequence of Chancellor Angela Merkel's unprecedented reservation to wind and solar power mean surges in renewable energy production making it easy for the nation's grids to handle its own electricity and imports.

"Kristen Stewart Drops 'Twilight' Movie Plans With Robert Pattinson: Lands New Role In 'Underwater' Thriller | Celeb Dirty Laundry

It looks like Kristen Stewart won't have any time on her hands to make another 'Twilight' movie with Robert Pattinson in the near future. In fact, new reports indicate that the Hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller, 'Underwater.'

According to Deadline, the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake. Kristen will star as Noah, a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember. And while there have been reports suggesting that Kristen might reunite with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson for another 'Twilight' film, at this point it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

Then again, many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another 'Twilight' movie made again is because Robert Pattinson doesn't want to work with Kristen Stewart again. After all, she absolutely humiliated him right before their break-up in 2012. Robert was devastated when he found out that Kristen was having a secret affair with director Rupert Sanders behind his back. His trust issues with Kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again.

Plus, Robert Pattinson has moved on with FKA Twigs. He doesn't want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life. Meanwhile, Kristen is dating model Stella Maxwell. The last thing Robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend. He wants to concentrate on his Hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life.

But for Kristen Stewart, she doesn't feel that way. She loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines. She even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another 'Twilight' movie if the script and timing were both right. She even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it, too.

What do you think of Kristen's new role in 'Underwater?' Does this mean that she's putting her 'Twilight' days behind her for good?

"Cher: Ready To Die!

The beat no longer goes on for CHER.

The freaked-out diva has become obsessed with her late ex-husband, Sonny Bono, and believes she’ll join him soon, shocked pals told The National ENQUIRER in a bombshell world exclusive.

“Cher truly believes the end is near for her,” said a family pal. “I’ve never seen anything like it! She’s scaring the hell out of everyone.”

According to the source, the 69-year-old showbiz legend spends most of her time revisiting her past with Sonny, her longtime performing partner who died on Jan. 5, 1998, at the age of 62.

“It’s all about Sonny nowadays,” said the source.

Most disturbing of all, “she’s been paying secret visits to Sonny’s grave and giving away many of her possessions,” added the source.

Sonny and Cher were married from 1964 to 1975, and charted six Top 10 hits, including the classics, “I Got You Babe” and “The Beat Goes On.”

He was killed in a horrible skiing accident in Nevada and is buried near Palm Springs, Calif., where he served as mayor and later was elected to Congress.

“Cher goes to his gravesite with flowers and comes back all weepy and looking like death warmed over,” said the source. “She’s even cried, ‘I’m ready to be with Sonny again.’ ”

As The ENQUIRER reported in April, the Oscar-winning “Moonstruck” star – who is worth a reported $320 million – is suffering from both physical ailments, and the stress of a turbulent personal life.

At the time, she was also dealing with her disastrous D2K concert tour, which was plagued by infighting, lawsuits and medical woes that left a “devastated” Cher canceling 23 shows.

Dealing with her children has also taken a debilitating toll on the “Mask” star, insiders said. Last year Cher forced her estranged son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his new bride to leave her Malibu home, which she believes is haunted by Sonny.

She’s also deeply concerned that her transgendered and outspoken son, Chaz, could be a target by appearing at gay pride rallies.

Meanwhile, the “Believe” singer’s longtime battle with the Epstein–Barr virus has wreaked havoc on her heart and kidneys.

At the time of her first bout with the viral infection – during which she vanished for five months in the early 1990s – Cher told a friend: “This disease makes me feel bone-weary, deeply depressed – and as though all my muscles have turned to Jell-O!”

As The ENQUIRER reported at the time, her publicist told us that doctors had outfitted her with a heart monitor after continuing kidney woes.

When contacted about the specific allegations in this story, her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg told The ENQUIRER that Cher had fully recovered and any claims that she’s headed for an early grave were false and inaccurate.

But recent photographs of a somber Cher on a visit to St. Tropez were telling: She had to be supported by friends who firmly grasped her arms, believing she was close to collapse. “Cher’s been there before and always loved it. But she regrets never having visited with Sonny,” said the source.

“They planned on going a number of times, but something always happened.

“Now, Cher wanted to go with Sonny on her mind. She’s calling it the visit she and Sonny ‘always wanted but never had.’ It’s heartbreaking.”

Despite the trip, the frustrated entertainer has confined herself to her Malibu mansion.

“Cher has a golf cart that she loves,” said one local. “She used to be seen driving [it] around Malibu with a hat and glasses. She would wave to people and chat, but those little rides seem to be a thing of the past.”

Other Malibu sources told The ENQUIRER that Cher seems “very isolated,” while former members of her inner circle are saddened to see her spending her days in bed using a laptop to rant on social media about politics.

“Her management even went to Cher to say she’s got to tone it down, because she’s coming across as angry,” another source said. “But she told them to f–k off.”

Added the friend: “It’s like Cher knows it’s all over, and she’s ready to go. She’s hoping Sonny will be there waiting for her in Heaven.”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\204fake.txt
"Halle Berry sparks pregnancy rumours after displaying baby bump on red carpet

Halle Berry, 50, has sparked rumours she is expecting her third child after debuting what looks like a ‘baby bump’ on the red carpet at the 16th Annual Chrysalis Butterfly Ball in Los Angeles.

The Oscar-winning actress looked stunning in a clinging silver sequinned dress and matching heels and posed for cameras with her hands on her tummy as though protectively cradling her ‘bump’.

Halle has yet to announce she is pregnant but when she turned to the side the bump was prominent in her dress and Halle seemed happy to show it off.

The star is not known to be dating anyone and last week posed on Instagram in a top that read ‘No more boyfriends’.

She captioned the photo: ‘Summer’s coming… let’s shine up our crowns ladies!’

Last night social media went into meltdown with speculation of who the baby daddy may be.

The Oscar-winner has two children already, having given birth to her second at the age of 47.

Halle had previously thought she was perimenopausal when she discovered she was pregnant with son Maceo to her French actor husband Olivier Martinez, who she divorced in December 2016.

The bump was even more prominent when Halle posed to the side [Picture: Splash] She has a nine-year-old daughter Nahla to Gabriel Aubry from a previous relationship.

Back in 2014, Halle said she was shocked to find out she was pregnant at 47.

‘They call it a geriatric pregnancy,’ she said at the time.

‘I was, you know, on my way … this is probably way TMI, but I was really, you know, kinda premenopausal so to have this happen was a huge [shock].’

‘I mean, I didn’t think it was possible to have another baby … So, I’ve learned never to say never.’

If she is she will be in good company as Janet Jackson recently gave birth at 50.

"Saudi Teenager Who Fled Family Embraces All Things Canadian. (O.K., Maybe Not Winter.)
By Catherine Porter

    Jan. 14, 2019

TORONTO — She wants to go to college to study architecture. She would like to take English classes. She is wondering about how to harness her newfound media stardom.

But mostly, the celebrated Saudi-turned-Canadian-refugee Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun just wants to experience what it is like to be a teenager, free to do what she wants and dress how she wants.

“I want to do crazy things I’ve never done before,” she said in an interview Monday evening, sitting in a classroom at a refugee center in downtown Toronto.

On just her third day in Canada, Ms. Alqunun, 18, seemed to be still a bit stunned.

In less than two weeks, she has gone from the cloistered life of a Saudi woman in Hail, a city in the northwestern part of the country, to the life of an independent woman on the other side of the world.

Now she can do things unimaginable for a woman at home.

“From the welcome I had and love I’ve been shown, I saw this is a country that respects human rights and the dignity of a person,” Ms. Alqunun said through an interpreter. “It’s also cold.”

(It was 30 degrees Fahrenheit in Toronto on Monday — 38 degrees colder than in Hail.)

Ms. Alqunun became a social media sensation, and a cause célèbre for the rights of women and refugees, after fleeing her family on Jan. 5 while they were on holiday in Kuwait.

Freed from the restrictions on women’s movement back home in Saudi Arabia, and using a friend's credit card, she bought a ticket for a flight to Australia with a layover in Bangkok — where Thai officials said they would send her back home.

Ms. Alqunun spent six nights holed up in a Bangkok airport hotel, opened a new Twitter account and mounted a campaign for asylum. “I’m afraid, my family WILL kill me,” she tweeted, adding later that her family had threatened to kill her before and considered her “as property or their slave.”

Furthering her danger, she renounced Islam on Twitter. “They will kill me because I fled and because I announced my atheism. They wanted me to pray and to wear a veil, and I didn’t want to.”

International outrage over the attempts to send her back to Saudi Arabia quickly mounted.

Although Ms. Alqunun had planned to fly on to Australia, the Canadian government granted her asylum. On Saturday morning, she arrived at the Toronto airport, where she was greeted by the Canadian foreign minister and a phalanx of reporters.
In Saudi Arabia, Ms. Alqunun was a first-year university student, studying basic science and math. One of 10 children of a well-off emir, she said that life had been financially comfortable, but that she had no freedom.
Things grew even harder, she said, when her father left the city and put her under the guardianship of her older brother. She described her life as one of strict rules and abuse at the hands of her family. After she cut her hair in a way her family did not approve, her brother locked her in a room for six months, she said. A few months ago, when she removed her niqab, he beat her and locked her up again, she said.

After days of silence, the first comments about the case have emerged from Saudi Arabia. In a statement, the head of the Saudi government-funded National Society for Human Rights accused countries of inciting “Saudi female delinquents” to rebel against their family values and seek asylum. He called the actions political, not humanitarian.

The case is sure to further fray relations between Canada and Saudi Arabia, which have been strained since last summer, when Canada’s foreign affairs ministry posted two Twitter messages calling for the release of imprisoned rights activists in Saudi Arabia. In response, the kingdom expelled the Canadian ambassador to Riyadh, recalled the Saudi ambassador to Ottawa, froze all new trade and investment deals, and ordered thousands of Saudi students studying in Canada to transfer elsewhere.

The Canadian government, however, did not back down.

Canada accepts tens of thousands of refugees a year, but few have Ms. Alqunun’s stardom or powerful, if newly formed, network. In just over one week, she has garnered 176,000 Twitter followers, forged relationships with human rights activists and been on the front pages of newspapers around the world.

No fewer than three GoFundMe campaigns have been launched in her name, raising more than $12,900 (17,200 Canadian dollars) already.a

Fame has come with its price though. She has received death threats online, credible enough for refugee settlement workers to provide her with security.

And Ms. Alqunun says she misses the kinship with her sisters, and worries that her family will take out its anger on her younger sister, who is still at home.

Ms. Alqunun had once hoped simply to fashion a normal life. Now, she is contemplating whether she should put her unexpected platform to use.

“I have a lot of followers,” she said. “My voice is heard. Maybe I can do something with it.”

But first, she will need to do some basics. The Canadian government offers refugees financial support for a year — and free English classes.

Over the next few weeks, refugee settlement workers will also help her get health insurance, a social insurance number and bank account. They will help her find an apartment and furnish it.

But Ms. Alqunun will have to learn how to go grocery shopping, and navigate the city on the bus and subway by herself — the sort of things she has never experienced before.

“It’s like moving from one planet to another. Nothing is the same,” said one Canadian women’s rights activist, Yasmine Mohammed, who helped raise more than $7,600 for Ms. Alqunun. “She has to focus on herself and her mental health before she tries to help other people out.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\34.txt

"Keith Urban Jealous: Nicole Kidman Admits She Begged HBO To Cast Alexander Skarsgard As Her Love Interest | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Nicole Kidman is making it pretty clear that she desperately wanted Alexander Skarsgard to be cast as her husband in ‘Big Little Lies.’ Nicole is starring in the new HBO drama series along with Reese Witherspoon, Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern. The show tells the story of three mothers who try to move on after a tragedy that almost destroyed their lives.

The Hollywood actress even said that she almost begged producers to cast Alexander, who is often regarded as one of the hottest stars in the celebrity world. In fact, Nicole even told Vulture in a new interview, “Yeah, he was so good. I wanted him badly! I was like come on, please. Come on, HBO, we’ve gotta get him. And, obviously, he’s very tall as well, which is really, really helpful for me. It’s not often that I look small. So physically he’s very dominating as well, which is frightening, but I take him on.”

With that being said, a lot of Nicole’s fans can’t help but wonder if she might be throwing a little shade towards her husband Keith Urban’s direction. After all, Nicole often towers him whenever they are on the red carpet together.

Plus, Nicole has even admitted that Keith doesn’t feel comfortable watching her love scenes with Alexander on ‘Big Little Lies.’ She said that even though Keith understands that her intimate sex scenes are part of her job, the country singer still watches them with only one eye open.

Of course, it’s not surprising that Nicole Kidman would want to work with someone like Alexander Skarsgard. He’s a Hollywood sex symbol. Plus, the characters on ‘Big Little Lies’ often comment on how beautiful Nicole and Alexander’s characters are on the show. Together, they are a perfect couple on the outside, but with plenty of deep dark secrets that no one knows about in the inside.

Knowing how much sex appeal he has, it’s no wonder that Nicole wanted to be paired with him on the small screen. No one else can play a troubled, yet sexy husband, father, and businessman the way Alexander does.

"Harry Styles Leaving One Direction Behind For Kendall Jenner?

In December, Harry Styles left his One Direction bandmates in Paris to meet Kendall Jenner for a romantic one-night rendezvous in London. At the time it seemed like a romantic gesture, but it may have been a foreboding sign of things to come. The two stars have been getting closer and closer, and the hot and heavy relationship is reportedly taking a serious toll on 1D.

Harry is starting to fall hard, and it's reportedly making him want to spend all of his time with Kendall instead of the band.

""Kendall's a sweet girl, but [the band] sees her as a bigger threat than Taylor Swift ever was,"" a source told OK! magazine. ""She seems to have cast a spell over Harry and it's disrupting other areas of his life because he's always wanting to spend time with her or chat with her on the phone when they're apart. It's causing a lot of unrest.""

Worse than Taylor - now that's saying something! But that assessment might actually be spot on - Kendall's reportedly causing so much tension within 1D that the boys' arguments are actually getting physical! ""The other day, Harry and Niall [Horan] almost came to blows when Niall confronted Harry when he showed up late for a meeting,"" the same source said. ""Things got out of hand before Zayn [Malik] stepped in to break them up.""

Guys! Don't you know it's supposed to be bros before hoes?!

Rumors about 1D splitting apart crop up almost on a daily basis, but this one seems to have more legs because Harry and Kendall really have been heating up. And it wouldn't be the first time that a sexy girlfriend got in between a band.

But hopefully claims of Kendall's negative influence on Harry and One Direction are overstated - and if not, we hope the guys of 1D will be able to work out whatever animosity has developed, and the lovestruck Harry can refocus on making music.

"Elsa ‘upset’ by Chris’ gushing about Charlize

They seem to have crafted the perfect life for their family in Byron Bay but things are reportedly not 100% happy in paradise for Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky.

According to NW, Elsa is not happy about her husband “gushing” about Charlize Theron (again) in a recent interview.

The Thor star had nothing but good things to say about the actress while speaking to W magazine.

“She’s smart as hell,” Chris raved about his Snow White And The Huntsman co-star.

An insider told NW: “If Chris is smart, he’ll stop talking Charlize up in public.”

“Elsa knows that he’ll never cheat, but a part of her does find it upsetting for Chris to be talking about Charlize so publicly when they’re not even promoting a film together. It’s more than a little disrespectful,” the source added.

Chris’ comment follows the praise the 33-year-old had for Charlize back in April when he said: “She’s incredible…She’s one of my favourites.”

Even KIISFM host Kyle Sandilands noticed the admiration Chris had for Charlize pointing out they haven’t worked together in four years “and the guy’s still talking about her. I bet that wife has a problem…”

However, Chris and Elsa both regularly gush about their relationship.

The couple relocated their family to Byron Bay a few years ago and their romance seem to be better than ever.

They have been married for seven years after meeting in 2010 and tying the knot just months later.

"Tom Cruise misses being with family; The Mummy actor to reconnect with daughter Suri Cruise?

Tom Cruise has not met his daughter Suri Cruise in the last three and a half years but looks like things are going to change for The Mummy actor. If reports are to be believed then Tom might reunite with his daughter Suri.

According to reports, the actor wants his 11-year-old daughter back as he misses being with family. Not only that, the actor is all set to marry again. Tom believed that he would not be ready to meet Suri until she goes to college, but after a recent interaction with a reporter, he changed his decision

""Tom has steered clear of Suri because of Katie and didn't feel he'd be able to come back into Suri's life until she was in college and away from Katie,"" a source close to the Top Gun actor told In Touch magazine. ""But now that he's in hot pursuit of a new wife, he wants Suri back in his life. He misses having a family.""

Tom apparently got inspired to reconnect with his daughter after a reporter asked him Suri's about future. Recently, a reporter asked Tom whether Suri will follow his and Katie Holmes' footsteps and enter the entertainment industry. Though he replied, ""You never know,"" the question sparked something in the father.

""The reporter's question triggered something in Tom and made him want to reconnect with Suri even more,"" the source said, adding, ""It's happening.""

However, Gossip Cop has debunked the report and reported that the reunion between the father and the daughter is not happening and the magazine reports are false.

In March, there were a few reports suggesting that the actor misses being with a family after his mother's death and wants to reconnect with his youngest daughter. However, the father-daughter reunion has not happened until now.

"Kim Kardashian displays shocking hair loss after 'relying on weaves'

She's left fans green with envy thanks to her incredible post-pregnancy weight loss. 



But it seems that Kim Kardashian's rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair. 



Images of the 33-year-old with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss, which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions.

And according to hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina, it could be Kim's rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss. 



Tatiana told MailOnline: 'It is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones, making it thicker and lusher, but when you have the baby most women find they  seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal.

'What with the rapid amount of weight Kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth, this may have accelerated the hair loss, giving sparser looking patches, we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline. 



Thinning out: Hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina told MailOnline that Kim's rapid post-pregnancy weight loss could have contributed to her thinning locks

 Where the real ends and the fake begins: The line of Kim's extensions could clearly be seen During pregnancy: Kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last May 'Birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume.' Tatiana added that Kim's apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with Traction Alopecia, and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesn't want to damage her hair further. 

 She told MailOnline: 'In spite of giving instant full thick hair, weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp, often too heavy and tight, the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and Traction Alopecia, and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth. Top knot trouble: Kim displayed the hair loss as she wore her hair up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week



'I would not recommend that Kim keep the weave in her hair, but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions, or a simple clip-in that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp.'

Kim isn't the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves.

"‘Breaking Bad’ Star Bryan Cranston Diagnosed With Cancer
HOLLYWOOD, California – 

In a tragic twist of fate, Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston may be facing a similar ordeal to that of his character from the hit TV series.

The actor, also known for his role in the TV series Malcolm In The Middle, has recently had his career diagnosed with a terminal case of cancer. A year and a half after the series finale, in which Cranston played cancer riddled Walter White, doctors have attributed Cranston’s career’s sickness to his minor role in 2014’s reboot of the Godzilla franchise.

“It’s a known carcinogen,” said famed oncologist Dr Hugh Hormones. “Taking small parts in disappointing remakes of classic movies is a surefire way to precipitate the disease. We warn actors time and time again, but after starring in long-running award-winning series, the temptation of getting back out there is just too great.”

Fans of the actor have come out in huge support of his ailing career, sending sympathetic tweets and reposting photos they had taken with him – most of them show the man with a still-healthy looking career.

“Breaking Bad was always gonna be impossible to top,” tweeted TheRealJohnJonson. “#WeLoveYouWalterWhite”

“Bryan Cranston will forever be Walter White in my heart,” posted JessePinkmanStillLives. “#IBoughtGodzillaOnBluRay #ItWasOnSale #SupportCranston”

However, it seems that Cranston may not the only member of the cast of the AMC hit to be stricken with this rampant disease. Co-star Aaron Paul is said to be undergoing tests after symptoms that his own career might be deteriorating due to the incurable illness.

“Aaron took few precautions in exposed himself to an even more severe carcinogen,” said Dr Hormones, referring to Paul’s part in the latest reimagining of the story of Moses, Exodus: Gods and Kings. In it, Paul takes the role of Joshua, whose only lines include shouting the name “Moses” unclearly. This comes hot on the heels of his action film Need For Speed, a film about fast cars that is, curiously, not based on the video game series of the same name, and is a movie that most people aren’t even aware exists.

Family members of both victims have announced that they will stand by their loved ones’ sides throughout, and will “fight this thing together.”

“Aaron and Bryan at least have each other to get through it with. Their careers have for so long been interlinked, and now they will until the end,” said a family friend of Cranston’s.

Reports, however, suggest that Paul may be exposing himself to yet another possibly fatal carcinogen, with rumors placing him in the role of the scarecrow in an as yet unannounced reboot of the Hollywood classic The Wizard of Oz.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\44.txt
"Are Kendall, Kylie Jenner and Gigi, Bella Hadid headed for a nasty feud?

It looks like a case of siblings' war. Two of the most popular siblings' duo – Kendall, Kylie and Bella, Gigi – are reported to be on the verge of a nasty feud.

The shocking claim comes days after Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner were spotted attending Cannes and vacationing together. But what went wrong? It appears that the Jenner mother, Kris Jenner, is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute.

According to a report by Star, the Jenner sisters and Hadid sisters are at war and Kris Jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict. Apparently, mom-manager has designed a plan to make her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, the next ""it"" girls of the fashion industry by replacing the Hadid siblings.

A source told the gossip website that Kris is ""setting the stage"" for a nasty fight between the young models. The outlet also claims, ""[Kris] is hell-bent on getting a contract for either Kendall or Kylie with Tommy [Hilfiger], like Gigi currently has.""

Adding to the speculation, the source explained, ""The bottom line is the Hadid girls have that 'it' factor, but try telling Kris. She will stop at nothing to make sure her children succeed. She's determined to have her daughters in the top spot.""

The claims sound dubious considering the fact that all the four stars are successful in their respective ways and have been closest of friends. This led to Gossip Cop reaching out to their sources to find out if the claims are true. As it turns out, the Star's claims are not true.

Gossip Cop writes, ""Kendall and Kylie are not at ""war"" with Gigi and Bella, nor is the matriarch plotting to have her daughters overtake the Hadids in the fashion world. What's more, the four stars are actually the best of friends, and any claims made otherwise are completely unfounded. They're not in competition with each other, but extremely supportive of one another. There is no feud between the sister pairs, but just the opposite.""

It comes as no surprise that this claim was false considering the bond Kendall, Kylie, Bella and Gigi share.

"Journalist who exposed football corruption shot dead in Ghana
An undercover Ghanaian journalist who helped expose corruption in African football has been shot dead in Accra.

Ahmed Husein was part of a team led by award-winning journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas, whose investigation led to the resignation of the head of the Ghana Football Association.

Dozens of football referees and officials in several countries were also banned as a result of the investigation, including the Nigerian national team coach, Salisu Yusuf, for receiving cash from undercover journalists posing as agents.

The director of the criminal investigations department, Maame Yaa Tiwaa Addo-Danquah, said: “Our men are on the ground currently gathering information. Everyone connected to this murder will be invited for questioning.”

Husein was shot in the neck and chest by unknown gunmen on his way home on Wednesday night in the capital Accra, police said. Anas tweeted: “Sad news, but we shall not be silenced. Rest in peace, Ahmed.”

Husein had previously made a complaint to police after a Ghanaian politician, Kennedy Agyapong, showed his photograph on a private television channel.

Agyapong promised payment for supporters who took retribution against Husein. “That boy that’s very dangerous, he lives here in Madina. If he comes here, beat him,” he said, pointing to Husein’s image.

Agyabeng added: “He invited the world to beat him up and said he will pay for it and now he has been killed,” he said. “How can you put pictures of someone out there and splash it on national TV and ask people to go after his life for a reward?”

The Committee to Protect Journalists called for an immediate investigation and for Ghanaian authorities to “ensure that threats against the press are taken seriously”.

Ghana ranked 23rd out of 180 countries in the Reporters Sans Frontières (RSF) 2018 World Press Freedom Index – an improvement of three places on the previous year. RSF has previously condemned threats against Anas after he revealed “threatening calls, intimidatory messages and suspicious vehicles near his home”.

The reporter, whose other exposés have lifted the lid on graft in the judicial system, is distinctive for wearing hats and face coverings to conceal his identity.

Ghana’s national media regulator condemned the killing. “It will be in the national interest to arrest the perpetrators of this crime,” its chairman, Yaw Boadu-Ayeboafo, said in a statement.

Ghanaian journalists condemned the killing of the 34-year-old reporter, who played a key role in last year’s investigation.

Last October, Fifa banned the former Ghana FA boss, Kwesi Nyantakyi, for life and fined him nearly $500,000 (£387,000) after he was seen on camera allegedly accepting bribes.

Nyantakyi was accused of requesting $11m to secure government contracts. Eight referees and assistant referees were also banned for life and 53 officials were subject to 10-year bans. Fourteen officials were exonerated.

The revelations rocked Ghana, a country where football is the national sport and which prides itself on being a stable democracy in an often turbulent region.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\38.txt

The chances of being struck by lightning once are high enough.

But one unfortunate man appears to have been electrocuted twice within the space of a minute by two almighty bolts of lightning.

The hapless pedestrian had been jogging along a quiet city street when CCTV captured the astonishing moment on April 11.

Shortly before the apparent freak accident a walker carrying an umbrella and a jogger had passed through the street unscathed.

They are followed later by a young couple walking arm-in-arm as they shelter from what could be light drizzle.

But the unlucky man then jogs in from the bottom of the screen wearing dark trousers and a heavy coat.

Seconds later a frightening bolt of electricity rips down from the heavens and zaps the man in his tracks.

He stumbles for a few feet before collapsing painfully face down onto the hard ground.

Around his motionless body a dark shadow forms, which could be blood or scorched tarmac.

After some 15 seconds the man begins to move his legs before struggling up from the ground. He clutches his head and sits for a moment to catch his breath.

The stunned jogger lifts himself up and goes on his way, resuming a brisk jog.

But seconds later after around ten yards a second bolt of powerful lightning strikes the man, knocking him to the ground again. Another dark shadow forms on the ground.

Thankfully, the man pulls himself to his feet and struggles away, even if he is a little confused by what just happened.

The astonishing video has become an internet sensation with thousands of people expressing their surprise that the unlucky man survived.

The chances of being struck by lighting once in a give year are around one in 700,000. The chance of being struck twice within such a short space of time are virtually unmeasurable.

It is not known where the video was recorded, although there is Chinese writing in the top corner of the screen.

Cynics suggested that so high was the probability of such a freak accident that the video might have been faked. 

Some internet users pointed to the lack of visible rain in the CCTV footage while one suggested that lightening hitting the ground would have caused the camera to shake.

Another stated that in the video the lightning lasted for only one frame, whereas, they said, real lightning would have 'overexposed the camera for at least a few frames on each strike'.

But other viewers said the video was genuine.

One wrote: 'Security cameras don't just shake every time it's windy don't they? Pause the video when the dude gets hit and look at the light, that's pretty hard to fake, don't you think?'

Another added: 'Photoshop can't make a thunder like that. Real.'

And one person wrote: 'I think this is the lesson for all of us - if you are hit by lightning don't get up because you will feel a second wave.'

Only around ten per cent of people who are struck by lightning die, usually because the bolt of electricity causes their heart and breathing to stop.

Those who survive tend to wake up from the shock within a few seconds but have little recollection of what happened before the injury. They could suffer minor burns and stroke-like symptoms. A doctor may later point to lightning strikes as the cause of injury.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\34.txt

Jennifer Lopez gets cozy with on-screen boyfriend Milo Ventimiglia
2017-11-07T01:52:40+0000
She's had many a handsome leading man in her romantic comedies.

And Jennifer Lopez added another dashing co-star to her repertoire as she was spotted filming with Milo Ventimiglia on Monday.

The superstar, 48, looked casual chic in an off-the-shoulder sweater as the two actors shot a romantic date scene for Second Act.

Daring to impress, Jennifer was seen walking to set in a fur-lined black parka over a grey sweater and camouflage pants.

Her trademark chestnut tresses were left long and loose as they cascaded over her petite shoulders.

The Shades Of Blue actress turned on the charm as she looked deeply into Milo's eyes over glasses of red wine in the Italian restaurant.

Sporting his usual mustache, the This Is Us hunk, 40, rocked a grey button down as he seemed in serious conversation with his dinner date.

Second Act has Jennifer returning to her romantic comedy roots that made her a household name.

Peter Segal will direct the film - which was developed by STXfilms with Jennifer from an idea conceived by Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Justin Zackham.

The movie is in the vein of Maid In Manhattan - a huge hit for Jennifer - and Working Girl - the Oscar winning comedy from 1988.

Jennifer will play a big-box store employee who reinvents her life and gets the chance to prove that street smarts are as valuable as a college degree.

Leah Remini is attached to portray the best friend and fellow employee of Jennifer's character while Vanessa Hudgens will play a boss at a consumer goods company.

Dan Bucatinsky, Annaleigh Ashford, and Freddie Stroma round out the cast.

Second Chance is scheduled to debut at the end of 2018.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\117fake.txt

"How 40,000 people used a Lockport woman's Social Security number
That's the most used – or misused – Social Security number in history, and it belonged to a woman from Lockport.
The federal government originally issued that number to Hilda Schrader Whitcher in the 1930s. But over the next four decades more than 40,000 people mistakenly claimed it for themselves.
How and why that happened is an intriguing story told by various media outlets over the years, most recently last week on National Public Radio's ""Planet Money"" podcast.
The Social Security Administration even devotes a page on its website to Whitcher's number.
It all began in 1938, when Whitcher's employer, the E.H. Ferree Co., a maker of leather goods based in Lockport, wanted to boost sales of its wallets. The company thought it would help to show customers how they could put their Social Security card in the wallet.
Douglas Patterson, an E.H. Ferree vice president and treasurer, decided to use the actual Social Security number of Whitcher, one of the company's leather cutters, on the display cards inserted into every wallet. He did it without her knowledge or permission.
""It seems like they should have thought this through better,"" said Ann Marie Linnabery, assistant director of the Niagara County Historical Society, which has written about Whitcher's number.
Now, Social Security, with its system of assigned numbers and cards, was relatively new at this point. The federal government had issued the first cards in 1936.
Maybe it's not surprising that a number of people buying an E.H. Ferree wallet from Woolworth's and other department stores mistakenly thought the card inserted inside was their official Social Security card, or they needed a number quickly to get a job.
That's despite the fact the E.H. Ferree cards were a different color than an official Social Security card, were smaller than an official card, had ""Specimen"" written across them – and came randomly in a wallet anyone could purchase.
In a 1983 interview with The Buffalo News, Whitcher recalled arriving at work one day to find co-workers singing, ""I found a million dollar baby."" Whitcher said she completed the refrain of the song popular at the time – ""In a five and ten cent store"" – but didn't understand what was going on.
It was only later that she learned her Social Security number was famous.
""I didn't know what to say. I was dumbfounded,"" Whitcher told The News.
In 1943, when the level of confusion was at its peak, 5,755 people were simultaneously using Whitcher's number.
The Social Security Administration publicized the problem in an attempt to get the public to stop using the erroneous cards. The agency also voided the number and issued Whitcher a new card.
As late as 1977, the government found 12 people still using Whitcher's original number.
Whitcher said in later interviews that the card mistake largely was an annoyance. Her husband, Hiram, told The News that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents even questioned her once about the widespread use of her Social Security number.
She said she couldn't believe how the problem snowballed among wallet shoppers.
""They started using the number,"" Whitcher told The News. ""They thought it was their own. I can't understand how people can be so stupid. I can't understand that.""
She said she didn't know how much money was mistakenly deposited into her Social Security account over the years before the agency straightened it out.
""I'd probably be a millionaire today if I had all the money,"" Whitcher said in 1983, four years before her death at the age of 88.
The E.H. Ferree company was at 57-61 Richmond Ave. in Lockport from 1914 until 1955. The building, renamed 57 Canal St., is now owned by Iskalo Development.
Linnabery, from the Niagara County Historical Society, said the misuse of Whitcher's Social Security number resonates today.
""We talk about identity theft now,"" she said. ""That was basically what happened to her back in that time, although people weren't thinking about identity theft in those days.""",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\5.txt

"Obama’s Troubling Internet Fund-Raising
WHERE IS THE MONEY COMING FROM ?

By MAUREEN DOWD
Published: June 29, 2008

OBAMA’S TROUBLING INTERNET FUND RAISING

Certainly the most interesting and potentially devastating phone call I have received during this election cycle came this week from one of the Obama’s campaign internet geeks. These are the staffers who devised Obama’s internet fund raising campaign which raised in the neighborhood of $200 million so far. That is more then twice the total funds raised by any candidate in history — and this was all from the internet campaign.

What I learned from this insider was shocking but I guess we shouldn’t be surprised that when it comes to fund raising there simply are no rules that can’t be broken and no ethics that prevail.

Obama’s internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking, lists saved from previous party campaigns and from

supporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites. Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.

Then, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were “programmed” by a very sophisticated user.

While the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers. The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries. One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.

Another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.

It became clear that these donations were very likely coming from sources other than American voters. This was discussed at length within the campaign and the decision was made that none of these donations violated campaign financing laws.

It was also decided that it was not the responsibility of the campaign to audit these millions of contributions as to the actual source (specific credit card number or bank transfer account numbers) to insure that none of these internet contributors exceeded the legal maximum donation on a cumulative basis of many small donations. They also found the record keeping was not complete enough to do it anyway.

This is a shocking revelation.

We have been concerned about the legality of “bundling” contributions after the recent exposure of illegal bundlers but now it appears we may have an even greater problem.

I guess we should have been somewhat suspicious when the numbers started to come out. We were told (no proof offered) that the Obama internet contributions were from $10.00 to $25.00 or so.

If the $200,000,000 is right, and the average contribution was $15.00, that would mean over 13 million individuals made contributions? That would also be 13 million contributions would need to be processed. How did all that happen?

I believe the Obama campaign’s internet fund raising needs a serious, in depth investigation and audit. It also appears the whole question of internet fund raising needs investigation by the legislature and perhaps new laws to insure it complies not only with the letter of these laws but the spirit as well.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\30.txt

"Rudy Giuliani: 'I never said there was no collusion' by Trump campaign
Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has insisted that he “never said there was no collusion” between Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign and Russia – only that Trump himself was not involved.

The former New York mayor said he did not know if others involved in the campaign had worked with Russia.

“I never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or between people in the campaign,” Giuliani said on CNN on Wednesday night.

“I said the president of the United States,” he added.

Later in the interview, Giuliani said: “If the collusion happened, it happened a long time ago.”

But he once again defended the president.

“There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC,” he said, referring to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and leaking the emails of senior Democrats during the 2016 presidential election campaign.

Thousands of emails taken from the accounts of staff at the DNC and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, were published by outlets including WikiLeaks.

On Tuesday, Trump had been obliged to state that he “never worked for Russia” following two reports that he may have been used as an asset by Moscow.

“It’s a disgrace that you even ask that question,” he told reporters on the White House lawn. “It’s all a big fat hoax.”

Both men’s comments come as special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into allegations of links between the Trump campaign and Russia, and obstruction of justice, looms large, punctuated by guilty pleas, convictions and indictments of former Trump associates.

These include his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort and Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.

Manafort has admitted to sharing polling data with a Russian during the 2016 presidential race, according to a court filing inadvertently made public by his lawyers.

But on Wednesday, Giuliani suggested that was “not collusion”, a change of stance from multiple previous statements such as one given to Axios in November about the Mueller investigation that: “I don’t think they have any evidence of collusion of any kind.”

“Polling data is given to everybody,” he told CNN on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Michael Cohen tried to rig online opinion polls in Trump’s favor before the 2016 election, when he was still acting as the candidate’s personal attorney and fixer.

In response, Cohen tweeted on Thursday morning: “As for the @WSJ article on poll rigging, what I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of @realDonaldTrump @POTUS. I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn’t deserve it.”

The Journal reported that Cohen is accused of paying a polling company to rig online results to Trump’s advantage, although the attempts were unsuccessful.

Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison in December for crimes including lying to Congress and facilitating illegal payments to silence two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, who alleged affairs with Trump. He has been cooperating with prosecutors and has agreed to testify to Congress in February.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\35.txt

"POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT “ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE” AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL
For the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.
To a chorus of thunderous applause, Pope Francis stated “because Muslims, Hindus and African Animists are also made in the very likeness and image of God, to hate them is to hate God! To reject them to is to reject God and the Gospel of Christ. Whether we worship at a church, a synagogue, a mosque or a mandir, it does not matter. Whether we call God, Jesus, Adonai, Allah or Krishna, we all worship the same God of love. This truth is self-evident to all who have love and humility in their hearts!”

In a speech that shocked many, the Pope claimed “All religions are true, because they are true in the hearts of all those who believe in them. What other kind of truth is there? In the past, the church has been harsh on those it deemed morally wrong or sinful. Today, we no longer judge. Like a loving father, we never condemn our children. Our church is big enough for heterosexuals and homosexuals, for the pro-life and the pro-choice! For conservatives and liberals, even communists are welcome and have joined us. We all love and worship the same God.”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\19.txt

"White Witch warns Angelina against using spells to woo back Brad


A white witch from North London has urged Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back ex-husband Brad Pitt.

Back in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.

'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,' Carrie told FEMAIL. 'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.

'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'

Carrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,

It was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.

Carrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.

'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.

'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'

'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.

Carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else’s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won’t work.  'When a person works magic to ""keep"" or ""get"" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said.  Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly.  Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy.  May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart’s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know?  Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover.  When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.' Then let the candle burn all the way down.

'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.

'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.

'It's like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.

'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.

Angelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.

She acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.

The process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.

Carrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.

'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.

'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the ""magic"" of another culture.'

The star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat, purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.

'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.

'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.

It's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.

'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.

'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'

Assisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.

'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'

When working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are – or have been – witches.

'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.

'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\108fake.txt
"Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the ""Real"" Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike

Beverly Hills| The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence, when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true.

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the ""real"" Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9 1966, after an argument during a Beatles' recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.

""When Paul died, we all panicked!"" claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. ""We didn't know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn't get along with John, at all.""

William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed ""disappear "" from records in 1966 and no traces of him can be found after Paul's alleged death.

Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.

He notably says that the entire Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officially formed a ""new"" band featuring a ""fictional"" member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul's replacement.

""We felt guilty about the deception"" added Ringo Starr. ""We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.""

Ringo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth, because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only other surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.

The rumors of Paul's death began more than 45 years ago, but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage. In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney's death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles' recordings. Clue-hunting rapidly proved infectious, and within a few weeks, it had become an international phenomenon. Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969.

Neither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage have commented Ringo Starr's declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world. Journalists and paparazzis from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are awaiting for the star to comment the allegations.

The British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years as the Member of the Order of the British Empire, Sir James Paul McCartney, during official ceremonies involving Queen Elizabeth II.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\060fake.txt

"Starbucks’ ‘Collapse into Cool’ Campaign
There appears to be no limit on what Starbucks will do to capitalize on the misforturnes of others.
A regular contributor to one of the online forums I participate in was appalled to walk into the Starbucks nearest the WTC site and see the attached poster on a wall. He complained to the staff and was basically told to get lost.

This is the same Starbucks that charged EMT workers $130 for water immediately following the collapse of the towers. (Note that word “collapse.”)

He wrote to the group about his experience and other members across the country went to their local Starbucks and saw the poster. Many were disgusted while others didn’t see what the fuss was about. Eventually, though, enough people from the group (as well as others) wrote and called to Starbucks national headquarters in Seattle that they announced last week that local stores have been instructed to take down the poster.

I not only understand what upset everyone but I think it is disgusting and between this and Starbucks’ behavior on September 11, I will never go there again. What do you think?",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\15.txt
"Pregnant Kylie Jenner Is 'Very Self-Conscious' About Her Changing Body, Says Source
Since Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy was confirmed nearly two months ago, the social media mogul has largely remained out of the spotlight — and she intends to stay that way, at least for now.

“Kylie is only trusting her closest friends and her sisters right now. She wants to reveal things on her own terms but she’s of course having fun teasing everyone. She knows all the attention is on her and her baby bump, but she won’t share until she wants to,” a source close to the Kylie Cosmetics founder tells PEOPLE.

In September, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that the 20-year-old reality star is due in February with her first child — a baby girl — with rapper Travis Scott, whom she has been dating since earlier this year after splitting from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Tyga in April.

“Travis is so excited about the baby. They’re both trying to enjoy this time for themselves and keep it private as long as they can. They know it’s going to be a frenzy when they do come out,” an insider close to the 25-year-old rapper tells PEOPLE.

“Travis is crazy about Kylie and he feels so lucky to have her and the baby,” adds the insider. “The family has been welcoming — they know how important it is to Kylie that everyone gets along.”

Although the couple is elated about becoming parents, the expectant Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is feeling self-conscious about her figure.

“Her body is changing and she’s very self-conscious about it,” says the source. “She’s always been insecure that she’s not as curvy or pretty as her sisters.”

Despite having feelings of insecurity as a result of her changing shape, the Lip Kit business mogul has her loving and supportive boyfriend by her side.

“Kylie and Travis are very happy together,” the source shares. “They spend time away from the spotlight and he’s been supportive.”

The reality star’s baby won’t be the only new member joining the famous KarJenner brood: Jenner’s older sister Kim Kardashian West is expecting her third child (via surrogate) with husband Kanye West.

"Allison Williams’ top-secret wedding revealed

Allison Williams is getting married on Saturday in a starry secret ceremony out west, Page Six can exclusively reveal.

The “Girls” star will wed CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen in front of guests including her father, Brian Williams, plus Bruce Springsteen, Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller, and Williams’ “Girls” castmates Lena Dunham, Zosia Mamet and Jemima Kirke.

Also expected are Seth Meyers and his wife Alexi Ashe, Bee Shaffer, Andy Cohen, Tom Hanks — who may even officiate at the wedding, according to a source — and his wife Rita Wilson, who plays Williams’ mother on “Girls.”

The source told us, “The wedding is being kept so secret that guests are being asked to fly to Denver, where they will be picked up and taken to the location, which is thought to be somewhere in Wyoming.

“The accommodations for all guests are being paid for and then many of the guests are flying to LA together for Sunday’s Emmys.”

Williams, 27, who has been engaged to Van Veen, 34, since February 2014, delayed her wedding plans due to the scandal which engulfed her newsman father, which saw him stepping down as anchor of NBC’s “Nightly News” earlier this year after he exaggerated stories about his bravery in situations including the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina.

She said in February during a Q&A with “Late Night” host Meyers at the 92Y, “This has been a really hard time. Obviously [it’s] toughest on my dad, who is sort of bearing the full burden of the responsibility for it … Current events started happening so that derailed [wedding plans] a little bit.”

After a six-month suspension, Brian Williams is due to make his return to TV, this time on MSNBC, next Tuesday, where he will be a breaking news anchor and will initially report on the Pope’s visit. It is believed he delayed his return to TV until after his daughter’s hush-hush wedding.

"Death Toll Rises in Kenya Attack as Distraught Relatives Scramble
By Reuben Kyama, Emily Oduor and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura
Abdalla Dahir and Feisal Ahmed were so close that they were almost always together. “If you couldn’t reach Abdalla, you called Feisal, and if you couldn’t reach Feisal, you called Abdalla,” said a mutual friend, Abdulahi Mohammed. “They even used to joke that they will one day die together.”

That sentiment became a prophecy on Tuesday. The two men, who worked for a London-based development company with offices in Nairobi, Kenya, were killed while having lunch on a restaurant terrace in a luxury hotel and office complex stormed by Shabab militants.

Kenya’s police chief, Joseph Boinnet, said Wednesday night that the fatalities had risen to 21 from 14, with six additional bodies retrieved from the attack site and the death of a police officer from injuries. The victims included an American and a British national.

Distraught relatives were left to scramble for more information at morgues and hospitals, as the Red Cross set up teams to help deal with the casualties and to provide counseling.
President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a speech to the nation that 700 civilians had been evacuated during the response to the assault.

“We will seek every person involved in planning, funding and executing this heinous act,” he said.

All the assailants had been “eliminated,” the president said, and a security operation was complete. He said the nation was on the highest alert “and shall remain so.”

Gunfire could be heard in the complex earlier on Wednesday, even after the authorities said that all the buildings in the area had been secured.

The attack underscored the persistence and potency of the Shabab, who are based in Somalia and have sought to impose their strict interpretation of Islam. The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars bankrolling anti-Shabab operations for years. The group carried out a deadly attack at the Westgate mall in the Kenyan capital in 2013 and several more since then.

Mr. Kenyatta made clear in his speech that the fight against the Shabab and other militant groups would be a long one, while trying to strike an optimistic note.

“We are also a nation that never forgets those who hurt her children,” he said. “We have prevailed against evil and shall continue to prevail.”
The State Department confirmed late Wednesday that the American victim was Jason Spindler. His friend Kevin Yu described Mr. Spindler as a gregarious, adventure-seeking traveler who was the co-founder of an investment firm, I-DEV International, and had previous stints as an investment banker in New York and as a Peace Corps volunteer in Peru. He was an avid rock climber and camper who practically “lived on a plane,” Mr. Yu said.

“He was interested in so many different things, and completely unafraid,” he said.

Mr. Spindler grew up in Houston, studied with Mr. Yu at the University of Texas at Austin, and after graduation worked in finance in New York. He was in the city when the Sept. 11 attack occurred, and volunteered to help at the scene, Mr. Yu said. He added that Mr. Spindler’s parents were on their way to Nairobi; their son would have turned 41 next week, and they had planned to celebrate his birthday there.

The Gatsby Charitable Foundation said that Luke Potter, its Africa programs director, was among the casualties. He had worked for the group for three and a half years, running projects in Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. The British Foreign Office identified him as a dual citizen of Britain and South Africa.

Mr. Mohammed, the friend of Mr. Dahir and Mr. Ahmed, said he had spent much of the day at a morgue, where he had to identify the bodies and write a statement, in addition to providing fingerprints and a DNA sample.
“They told us everybody is a suspect,” he said.

The two victims had worked for Adam Smith International, which said that one of its employees had also been killed in the mall attack in 2013. The company said that 50 staff members and consultants had been evacuated during the more recent attack.

The siege began around 3 p.m. Tuesday, when four men reportedly jumped out of a white car, opened fire at a security checkpoint and blasted their way into the complex. Security footage shows the gunmen calmly fanning out inside the complex before beginning their rampage.

The police and counterterrorism forces quickly responded. Gun battles were fought and cars burned as the police rushed people out of the complex.

“The operation was executed very strictly and precisely,” said Kenya’s interior secretary, Fred Matiang’i, speaking from the site of the attack shortly after the operation ended. “We are moving now to Phase 2,” which he described as “handling the criminals.”

Ronald Ng’eno, who works in public relations, was in his office at the complex when he heard a loud explosion followed by gunshots. “We tried to escape, but we soon realized the attackers were coming from outside,” he said. “That’s when we decided to hide in a bathroom. Luckily, they didn’t come looking for us.”
Mr. Ng’eno, 38, said the rescue had been well coordinated. “I can say the rescue mission was very swift; it was done very fast, otherwise the attackers would have found us.”

Brenda Onguti, a health care worker, described being at the Secret Garden cafe when she heard a bomb and saw smoke, although she initially thought the source of the commotion was a gas cylinder.

Her father, Dr. Meshak Onguti, said, “She sent me a message saying they had been attacked, and as time went on, she was saying, ‘I love you; it looks like the guns are now close to us.’”

He added: “It was terrifying. She said she loved us, and that’s what affected us most.”

A loud blast was heard coming from the complex on Wednesday, briefly startling those who heard it, but a journalist at the scene said it was part of a “mopping up” operation by the police, who were detonating grenades left by the attackers.

Dusit International, which runs the DusitD2 hotel in the complex, said that the hotel had been temporarily closed and that guests had been taken elsewhere in the city, The Associated Press reported.

In his speech, Mr. Kenyatta sought to project an air of normalcy, encouraging everyone to go about their daily business.

“We assure every citizen and foreigner that you are safe,” he said.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\26.txt

"Social Media Addicted Kim Kardashian Slammed For Ignoring No-Phone Rule At Serena Williams’ Wedding!

An insider told us that a babysitter followed the reality TV star to make sure she respected the rules. Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian’s wedding was one to remember for sure, and Kim Kardashian was also there. But as we’ve learned, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians celeb has trouble staying away from social media for too long.

One source present at the Beauty and the Beast themed ceremony revealed that Kanye’s wife was reprimanded not once but twice for breaking the tennis champion’s no-phone rule.

What’s more, Serena apparently hired a ‘babysitter’ who was to follow Kim around the venue and stop her from taking any selfies.

‘Everyone was worried that Kim would take pictures and ruin the exclusive with Vogue,’ the insider explained.

As fans of the sportswoman may already know, Williams and Ohanian made sure to invite Vogue editor Anna Wintour at the wedding as one of the honor guests.

Of course, the ultimate goal was to keep all of the pictures away from the press so they could give Vogue the exclusive rights to publish them later.

If Barack Obama would apply for a job with the FBI or with the Secret Service, he would be disqualified because of his past associations with William Ayers, a known (and unrepentant) terrorist. If elected President, he would not qualify to be his own body guard! Ayers was a founder in 1969 of the violent antiwar group the Weathermen, which took responsibility for at least 12 bombings between 1970 and 1974. A pipe bomb attributed to the group killed a police officer and severely injured another in 1970, and three of the group's own members were killed in a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse in which they were making bombs. Ayers was investigated in connection with the group's activities, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He emerged from hiding, earned a doctorate in education from Columbia University, and is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Like Obama, he lives on the South Side of Chicago.

Obama and Ayers are both active in politics and civic life in the city.

“The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is bred to be a companion,” she revealed about the breed’s behavior patterns. “I see that they are prone to separation anxiety because they bond very strongly with their humans. They’re essentially lap dogs, though they wouldn’t quite fall into the Toy category. Carrying it with her everywhere will make it tough for it to leave her if she ever needs to leave the house because they do get very attached.” Selena was last spotted holding tight to her precious brown and white dog on Sept. 15, while leaving the Chelsea apartment she shares with her loving boyfriend.

The “Fetish” singer recently made a heartbreaking confession, admitting that she received a kidney from her BFF, Francia Raisa, 29, over the summer and that’s why she was MIA. Due to her battle with Lupus, she had to get the surgery to improve her health. While she heals, Selena and The Weeknd have been loving getting to know their new pup and they’ve clearly formed a bond. He even shared a hilarious video of Charlie chewing on his sneakers and joked, “not the kicks fam.” As we previously reported, The Weeknd majorly stepped in to be a support system for Selena, so she’s surrounded by love!

Jennifer Lawrence, who is heart of millions of boys, recently made all her fans shocked. Well it was not in the movie, but from the news; rather we say a rumour having an affair with Chris Pratt. Most of us' mind freeze because of these alleged highlights in tabloids, but later both of them finely denied. As of Jennifer's choice, she has chosen to be single for now; while Chris is already tied with Anna Faris. Faris feels insecurity because of this faked news fueling the tabloids about love between her husband Chris and Jennifer though. Well, is it true or not, we will cover it in this article!

Chris and Jennifer were busy in shooting for their upcoming movie 'Passengers' when the spark of their love life was alleged for the first time. According to some source, the duo was pretty together most of times, which helped in birth of affair rumour.

This news was no new for Chris and Jenny, while it seriously hit his wife Faris. She was throbbed from the news of her husband. Faris herself admitted about her insecurity.

'I know this news is not true, but I am human too; and still I feel too bad of having my husband being involved in such affair rumour.'

As indicated in News Every Day, Anna felt vulnerable when she heard this news for the first time. When the news spread, she wanted it to go off as it was hurting her heart.

Although this rumour spread all over internet and media, it finally turned off when Jennifer herself denied the news. Moreover, she also stated being jealous of this wonderful loving couple.

"Kim and Kanye's marriage on the rocks as she's pictured WITHOUT wedding ring

FRIENDS say Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s marriage is over.

US reality star Kim, 36, ditched her wedding ring as her relationship with the rapper hit rock bottom.

Kim ordered husband Kanye to stay away from her family’s traditional Christmas Eve bash, friends revealed last night.

Her wedding finger was bare on Saturday night as she partied with her mum and sisters at their annual festive gathering in LA.

Troubled rapper Kanye, 39, instead went to the cinema with friends.

But he then defied Kim’s warning by making a late appearance at the event.

However, she is said to have blanked her husband and insiders last night claimed their two-year marriage is “as good as over”.



 Kendall Jenner says family are praying for Kanye West's recovery

It comes at the end of a nightmare 2016 for the couple which saw Kim, 36, robbed at gunpoint in Paris in October and Kanye hospitalised a month later after a mental breakdown.

The pair put on a united front with their daughter North, three, at a ­performance of The Nutcracker ballet at an LA theatre on Friday.

However, onlookers revealed the ­couple — who also have a year-old son Saint — barely spoke to each other.

A source said: “Kim and Kanye’s marriage is as good as over. It’s looking bleak.

""She didn’t want Kanye at her mum’s Christmas bash this year, as she felt it was the first time she could really let her hair down.

“But he made a late show and spent the last hour just sitting on the couch talking to Scott Disick [dad of Kourtney’s kids] — he was a total wallflower.

“On Friday they took North to see The Nutcracker but they barely spoke or interacted inside.

""The tensions were  visible. Neither of them are in a happy place right now.

“He spent Christmas morning at Kris’ [Kim’s mum] to make things as normal for the kids as possible, but it’s just a matter of timing.

""The only thing that might keep them together is the kids.”



 New video of Kanye West ranting before he stops Sacramento gig early

Kim, who wore a gold dress at the Christmas Eve party in Calabasas, blew kisses in a video shared on her sister Khloe’s Snapchat account.

She was also sporting a new lip ring but her wedding band was off.

In the video, Khloe, 32, can be heard saying: “How dope is my f***ing sister? Look at this dress. And look at the jewellery. You are a bad*** bitch, Kim.”

The US reality star has barely been seen in public since her Paris ordeal, when she was bound and robbed at gunpoint in a reported £8.5million heist.

Kanye has cancelled all tour dates after coming out of hospital at the end of November.

He suffered a mental breakdown, with a cousin claiming he has “stopped trusting people”.

Lawrence Franklin claimed last week Kanye’s decline started after he paid £200,000 to a relative who was threatening to leak a sex tape of him.

Kim and Kanye have  also reportedly been  in counselling while the rapper is  receiving therapy.

Kim is said to be still angry after Kanye flew to New York for a meeting with President-elect Donald Trump within hours of leaving hospital.

A source said: “It was the worst thing that he has ever done in her eyes. When she tried to get him to call it off and come home, he refused.”

Any break-up is likely to lead to a complicated split of Kanye’s fortune, estimated by Forbes to be £145million.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\176fake.txt

"Doctors Admit “Crystal Meth Is
Actually Good For You”
Doctors have today admitted that they have been wrong about crystal meth this whole time and that the powerful narcotic is actually amazingly beneficial for health and well being.
“It increases concentration and drive, providing a much needed energy boost for the carrying out of petty crimes and handbag robberies,” confirmed Department of Health spokesperson Dr. William Gould. “A strict diet of crystal meth is shown to improve brain function making it easier to count coins collected on the street by begging with a coffee cup.”
Dr. Gould claimed that crystal meth contains “zero saturated fats and is perfect for people who are on a low carb diet” while also providing “100% of your daily methamphetamine needs”.
“A strict crystal meth diet also helps people shed unwanted pounds, hair and teeth and promotes the growth of healthy scabs and unclean fingernails,” continued the report which assessed the health of 1000 meth addicts and concluded that they had the rugged lean health of a 19th century street urchin with taut, tense muscles from constant alertness coupled with an immunity to most infections from living in their own filth for long periods at a time.
“It’s absolutely fantastic as an appetite suppressant, often meth users will simply forget about having to eat which will eliminate a flabby stomach and give the face a beautiful sunken emaciated look,” continued Dr. Gould who recommended that crystal meth should be enjoyed as part of a healthy diet that involves plenty of alcohol, cigarettes and unprotected sex.
“If people follow the crystal meth diet then they can expect to see results ranging from a reduction in unwanted bone density, a decrease in harmful bowel movements and removal of unwanted restorative sleep, within mere days of trying the super drug.”

"Ellen DeGeneres Is Now In The Middle Of Kelly Ripa And Michael Strahan’s Feud After Segment On Her Show

It is a known fact that there is bad blood between Kelly Ripa and her former co-chair, Michael Strahan, and now Ellen DeGeneres is caught in the middle.

Last month, the host of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Strahan sat down for a silly segment.

The two popular TV personalities tackled various topics. The episode was well received, and the millions of people who watched it saw nothing out of the ordinary.

However, according to sources, who spoke to Star, Portia de Rossi’s wife is having what would be considered as buyer’s remorse.

It is being claimed that the host of LIVE did not appreciate DeGeneres’ having her nemesis on the show.

According to the the the publication, Ripa felt betrayed by DeGeneres whom she considered as a friend.

Aware that she got on Ripa’s nerves, DeGeneres has allegedly reached out and apologized for the mistake.

It is not known if Ripa has accepted such apology nor if the ladies have been able to amend their friendship.

The former American football defensive end and Ripa were the co-hosts of Live! with Kelly and Michael from 2012 to 2016.

In spring 2016, he abruptly left the show to join ABC morning television show, Good Morning America.

The ex-athlete was slammed on numerous occasions by Ripa who said she was furious over Strahan’s decision to dump her without warning.

Strahan hit back by stating: “The most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy because I value the way I carry myself. I do not want people to see me as ‘Oh, he just ran out, just left them there.’ That is just not true.”

Strahan confirmed that they no longer talk.

In a past interview, he said: “At one point I think we were friends. I do not know what happened at the end. I learned a lot from her, though.”

He added: “I was not surprised by her reaction at all, but I cannot control somebody else’s actions. I was there four years, and it is about more than just being in front of the camera.”

An article recently appeared on BET, where an insider said Strahan wants to have a sit-down with Ripa.

The source revealed: “Michael is 100% behind meeting with Kelly and clearing the air. These two were TV-husband-and-wife for many years and to go from seeing someone five days a week to having zero contact makes no sense to him. Through mutual friends, Michael has made it clear that he would love to set up drinks or a private meeting with Kelly.”

"PLOT TWIST IN 'FATHER-SON' MOVIEMAKER MYSTERY

Forget ""Pearl Harbor"" – Hollywood is buzzing about a true-life scandal involving the paternity of the $140 million blockbuster's director, Michael Bay.

Finally addressing rumors that have circulated for years, legendary director John Frankenheimer admitted he had a one-night stand with the adopted Bay's birth mother, who claimed he was Bay's dad – and that he paid her off.

But Frankenheimer denied ""absolutely, categorically"" that he is the younger director's father.

""We had tests done, and I am not his father,"" Frankenheimer told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published yesterday.

Bay, 37, who's in Honolulu for the premiere of ""Pearl Harbor,"" declined to respond to the bombshell revelation.

""It's a private matter,"" Bay said of the story – which Frankenheimer, 71, unleashed just five days before the release of ""Pearl Harbor,"" one of the summer's most highly anticipated movies.

The older director said his ""one-night stand"" with Bay's birth mom – who was not identified – happened at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel while he was making ""Seven Days in May"" in 1963.

Months later, Frankenheimer got a call from his lawyer, the late Frank Wells, who said the woman was pregnant – and had named Frankenheimer as the father.

""I asked Wells, 'What can we do?'"" said Frankenheimer, who feared a scandal would hurt his career. ""We can pay her off,"" the director quoted Wells as advising him. So Frankenheimer paid the mother $7,500, and says he ""didn't hear anything more about this"" until 16 years ago.

By the mid-1980s, Bay, adopted and raised by Jimmy and Harriet Bay in L.A.'s Westwood section, was an aspiring filmmaker trying to find his birth parents.

""I [did] a little investigation,"" Bay told the Times. ""I found [my mom] in three days.""

Then Frankenheimer got a call from the woman's lawyer.

""He said there is a young man at Wesleyan University, and he wants to find out who his real parents are,"" Frankenheimer recalled.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\058fake.txt
"China has some of world's most advanced weapon systems, Pentagon warns
China is on the cusp of fielding some of the world’s most advanced weapons systems – and in some cases already has surpassed its rivals, a Pentagon assessment found.

An unclassified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency says Beijing has made enormous military strides in recent years, thanks partly to domestic laws forcing foreign partners to divulge technical secrets in exchange for access to China’s vast market.

As a result of “acquiring technology by any means available,” China now is at the leading edge on a range of technologies, including with its naval designs, with medium- and intermediate-range missiles, and with hypersonic weapons – where missiles can fly at many times the speed of sound and dodge missile-defense systems.

“The result of this multifaceted approach to technology acquisition is a PLA (People’s Liberation Army) on the verge of fielding some of the most modern weapon systems in the world,” states the report, entitled “China Military Power.”

“In some areas, it already leads the world.”

China’s increasing military might means it has advanced capabilities in the air, at sea, in space and in cyberspace that will “enable China to impose its will in the region,” the report notes.

A particular focus for Beijing has been the prospect of an eventual conflict with Taiwan, which China sees as part of its territory.

Beijing has said it will not hesitate to use force if Taipei formally declares independence, or in the case of external intervention – including by the United States, the island’s most powerful unofficial ally.

Speaking to Pentagon reporters, a senior defense intelligence official said he was worried China’s military is now advanced enough that PLA generals could feel confident they could invade Taiwan.

“The biggest concern is that as a lot of these technologies mature... [China] will reach a point where internally within their decision-making they will decide that using military force for a regional conflict is something that is more imminent,” the official said on condition of anonymity.

Taiwan is a self-ruled island and has its own currency, flag and government, but is not recognized as an independent state by the United Nations.

Still, the official noted, China has not fought in a war for 40 years and its massive military and joint command structure lacks experience in real-world conflict.

“It will take a while for [the PLA] to be able to work these [military] services together, to be able to work these joint theaters and to be able to deal with a large, complex operation,” the official said.

The intelligence report said China is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers capable of striking regional and global targets.

Such planes will likely reach initial operational capability by about 2025, the report notes.

The official added that China keeps a lot of its military development secret by conducting research in underground complexes, away from the prying eyes of satellites.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\36.txt
"Sour Note! Zayn Forced Into Disastrous Duet With Taylor

RadarOnline.com has learned Zayn Malik and Taylor Swift’s Fifty Shades Darker duet only came about after he was forced to collaborate with the superstar.

The former One Direction singer recorded the track “I Don’t Want To Live Forever” for the film’s soundtrack, but a source noted Swift wasn’t a part of his original plan.

“Zayn loved the song and wanted it for himself; he was desperate to record it as a solo track and thought it would be a real career boost,” the source explained.

“It has all of the high notes he can reach and was perfect, but movie bosses said it had to be a collaboration and wanted him to work with Taylor.”

According to the source, 24-year-old Malik relented because Swift, 27, is one of the biggest pop star on the planet — and she happens to be best friends with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid.

Still, “It was a surprise to everyone,” said the source, noting that “it’s not as if they’re really great friends and they didn’t even appear in scenes together for the video.”

Unfortunately, Malik’s decision may come back to haunt him.

“The song was a hit with movie fans, but it wasn’t massively well received by Taylor or Zayn’s hard-core fan base,” the source told Radar.

The situation isn’t the only setback Malik’s weathered recently. He was recently told he couldn’t perform on Saturday Night Live with Jimmy Fallon, who chose Harry Styles over him.

“His team tried to get him on SNL to perform his latest track but they told him no,” the source told Radar.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized President Donald Trump after the GOP-backed health care bill failed to garner enough support for a vote on the House floor Friday, saying the president showed two unhelpful traits during negotiations.

"POPE FRANCIS CONDEMNS RACISM AND DECLARES THAT “ALL RELIGIONS ARE TRUE” AT HISTORIC THIRD VATICAN COUNCIL
For the last six months, Catholic cardinals, bishops and theologians have been deliberating in Vatican City, discussing the future of the church and redefining long-held Catholic doctrines and dogmas. The Third Vatican Council, is undoubtedly the largest and most important since the Second Vatican Council was concluded in 1962. Pope Francis convened the new council to “finally finish the work of the Second Vatican Council.” While some traditionalists and conservative reactionaries on the far right have decried these efforts, they have delighted progressives around the world.

The Third Vatican Council concluded today with Pope Francis announcing that Catholicism is now a “modern and reasonable religion, which has undergone evolutionary changes. The time has come to abandon all intolerance. We must recognize that religious truth evolves and changes. Truth is not absolute or set in stone. Even atheists acknowledge the divine. Through acts of love and charity the atheist acknowledges God as well, and redeems his own soul, becoming an active participant in the redemption of humanity.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\36.txt
"Will Kim Kardashian Divorce Kanye West?

Kim Kardashian is considering a new story line for 2017. Two and a half years after she and Kanye West wed in a multimillion-dollar affair at a 16th century Italian fortress, ""she wants a divorce,"" a Kardashian friend claims in the new issue of Us Weekly. Find out more in the video above and from details below.

Previously married to record producer Damon Thomas and basketball pro Kris Humphries, the 36-year-old isn't rushing to file papers just yet, adds the pal, but she is planning her next steps. ""It will take some time before she can do anything,"" claims the friend, alleging that she's trying to build a case for full custody of kids North, 3, and Saint, 12 months, ""but she doesn't want to stay married.""

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is already distancing herself from the ""Fade"" rapper, 39. Since his November 30 release from UCLA Medical Center's Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital - following a nine-day stay for what his physician Michael Farzam dubbed an episode of ""temporary psychosis"" - West has been receiving outpatient treatment at an L.A.-area rental, multiple sources tell Us.

Kardashian, who has remained with the children at their 9,000-square-foot spread in L.A.'s Bel Air, ""is being very protective and doesn't want Kanye around the kids right now,"" explains the friend.



Still, the Selfish author hasn't entirely shut out West. Hours after the 21-time Grammy winner was released, he attended the balloon-filled ""low-key"" family party Kardashian held for Saint days before his December 5 birthday, says a West insider.



The Kardashian friend says she won't make any decisions until West is fully recovered. Until then, adds the pal, ""she's being a supportive wife."" And the reality star - who has been in self-imposed seclusion since being robbed in Paris October 3 - is happy the musician is on the mend.



""She cares about Kanye and feels relieved he's getting the help he needs,"" continues the friend, ""but she's felt trapped for a while.""

"Kim Kardashian Hires Team To Help Her Become More ‘Political’ – ‘I Want To Speak Out More About Political Issues’

The controversial reality TV star really wants to change her reputation. We have learned that Kim Kardashian wants to have a much more political image and she’s already making the first few steps in that direction.

According to a source close to the famous family, Kim would like to hire herself a political publicist and Kanye West has been looking for one.

In a recent interview with Harper’s Bazaar Arabia, Kim revealed that she’d love to become a more politically active celeb but is scared of making any mistakes and offending people.

‘Sometimes I feel like I want to speak out more about political issues. You have to be really careful about what you say, because a lot of things can be taken in the wrong context and I always want to be respectful; I do not want to hurt anyone’s feelings. I said once before that I am not really a feminist. But I feel like I do a lot more than people that claim that they are feminist. To clarify what I said before: I feel in my soul I am a feminist. I just don not need labels to make me feel or know what I am inside,’ the Kardashian explained.

She went on to say that for her, feminists are all of the girls around us and on social media that stand up for themselves and for certain issues.

For the KUWK star, those women are the most empowering.

Do you think it’s a good idea for Kim to become more vocal about her political views?",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\128fake.txt

"I have only heard the story behind this picture...
I have only heard the story behind this picture once, but it literally brought tears to my eyes. On September 11, 2001, a hijacked plane knifed into the side of the Pentagon. We all know that. What very few people have heard is shortly afterwards, the director of a nursery in the building stood looking at the children in her charge, wondering how to move all of the babies and toddlers to safety.

A marine rushed into the room and asked if she was alright. She needed help and she told him that. He turned and ran out; the woman assumed that he had gone away for good. As she formulated a plan of action, she heard footsteps in the hall.

The man had returned—this time, though, he was not alone. At least forty other Marines followed him. They picked up the babies in their cribs, the toddlers, the helpless infants. They carried them through the halls and to a nearby park, where they arranged the cribs in a circle and set the toddlers in the middle. Then they stood guard outside, never allowing the children to be unattended.

When I first saw this picture, I thought that the man carrying the children was their father. Now I realize that he was not related to them by blood, but by nationality. He is an American. They are American children. He is not their father, he is their protector. He’s a United States Marine.

"O.J. Simpson will agree to Khloe Kardashian paternity test if she visits him in prison, former guard says

O.J. Simpson would reportedly take a paternity test to see if Khloe Kardashian is his daughter, but there's one catch: The reality star would need to visit him in prison.

The former football star, a close friend of late lawyer Robert Kardashian, will consent to a mouth swab but wants the ""Kocktails with Khloe"" starlet to ""show him a little respect"" and stop by the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, according to the Daily Mail Online.

The website cites Jeffrey Felix, a former Lovelock prison guard who claims the facility has given permission for the test, as its source. Felix also penned a book about Simpson called ""Guarding the Juice.""

""He wants to talk to her about some other things too, but more importantly like her he wants to know if she is his daughter,"" Felix said.

In the new documentary ""The Man Who Saved O.J. Simpson,"" Felix claimed the 31-year-old Kardashian had begged Simpson to put the paternity question to rest with a test.

Kardashian is the third of four children born to Robert Kardashian, who died of esophageal cancer in 2003, and Kris Jenner, who divorced him in 1991.

The reality star set off ceaseless rumors after speculating on a 2009 episode of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" that she might be adopted — and even swabbed her mom's mouth for a DNA test.

They continued to fend off gossip over Kardashian's paternity, particularly after Robert Kardashian's ex-wives Jan Ashley and Ellen Kardashian, who he married after divorcing Jenner, suggested in a 2012 Star Magazine story that she wasn't a member of the famous family.

Khloe Kardashian got first taste of racism during O.J. trial
""The audacity you have to mention my father's name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low,"" Kardashian, then married to Lamar Odom, tweeted at the time. ""YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).""

Jenner later chimed in during a ""Good Morning America"" interview, calling the theory ""crap"" and telling its promoters to ""get a life.""

""I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everything’s good. We’re all good,"" the momager said.

The ex-NFL star was famously acquitted of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in the 1995 ""Trial of the Century,"" during which Robert Kardashian served as a member of Simpson's legal dream team.

Jenner, who has admitted she wasn’t faithful to the trial lawyer during their marriage, was a close friend of Brown Simpson.

"Selena Gomez Is ‘Crazy In Love’ With Justin After Reuniting: She’s ‘Light & Joyful’

If Selena Gomez seems like she’s living her best life since reuniting with Justin Bieber — she is! We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE that Sel’s in ‘love’ and happy to be back with Biebs.


Are Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, the new Beyonce and JAY-Z? To Sel, they are because like JAY and Bey, a Selena insider EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that she’s “just so crazy in love with Justin.” Aww. How sweet. Jelena may not cover Bey and JAY’s iconic 2003 hit, “Crazy In Love,” anytime soon, but Selena’s living the song 24/7. She’s even changing the minds of doubters and haters, all with the power of her love.

“As much as people around her are worried that she’ll end up heartbroken all over again, it’s hard not to be happy for her,” the source tells HollywoodLife.com. “She tried her best to put things with him behind her and for a long time it seemed like she had. But it’s obvious now that she was carrying a heavy weight around with her this whole time. Now that she’s back with Justin that weight has lifted, she just seems very light and joyful.”

It seems that Justin feels the same way, as he’s reportedly working on being a “better person” for Selena. Justin, who notoriously left Selena’s heart broken in two in the past, is reportedly changing his ways to make her happy, which in turn, makes them both happy. He’s even supposedly considering settling down with Selena in the future. Of course, before he could even consider getting down on one knee, Selena needs to convince her family and friends that he’s legit. Considering the Biebs was absent from the Selena Gomez family Thanksgiving, he may have a ways to go on that.

Selena Gomez​ reacts to The Weeknd​ going on a dinner date with Katy Perry​.
 
Plus, Selena’s fans may need to find their chill over this Jelena reunion. Justin reportedly “unliked” a photo of Selena’s blonde makeover, which caused Selenators to demand she dump him. Gasp! High treason! (Kidding.) Yeah, calling for these two split seems a bit harsh for a social media slip-up, right? Considering how much Selena is “in love” with Justin, perhaps her fans could relax a bit?

Foxx - who has two daughters, 23-year-old model Corrine and eight-year-old Annalise - began learning the piano when he was just five years old and by the time he was a teenager he was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church in Texas.

He has carried his musical talents and passion through to his career, releasing five albums and collaborating with other artists, including rapper Kanye West on his 2005 smash hit 'Gold Digger'.

This is one note I’ll gladly pass on. The notion that we could raise $16 million by buying a book of stamps is powerful!

As you may be aware, October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The U.S. Postal Service recently released its “Fund the Cure” stamp to help fund breast cancer research. The stamp was designed by Ethel Kessler of Bethesda, Maryland.

It is important that we take a stand against this disease that kills and maims so many of our mothers, sisters, friends. Instead of the normal $.33 for a stamp, this one costs $.40. The additional $.07 will go to breast cancer research. A “normal” book costs $6.60. This one is only $8.00. It takes a few minutes in line at the Post Office and means so much. If all stamps are sold, it will raise an additional $16,000,000 for this vital research! Just as important as the money is our support. What a statement it would make if the stamp outsold the lottery this week. What a statement it would make that we care.

I urge each of you to do two things TODAY:

1. Go out and purchase some of these stamps.

Comic Jim Carrey is secretly a follower of a kooky conspiracy nut who believes alien reptiles run the world! Even nuttier, the Dumb and Dumber star plans to go public with his commitment to whack job David Icke’s bizarre theory!

“Icke has spent years wooing Jim, and it’s finally paid off. Jim is now a disciple of this guy!” claimed a source.

The crazy coupling helps explain Carrey’s bizarre behavior during New York Fashion Week when he declared he “didn’t exist.”

Icke, a 65-year-old former soccer player, is a British broadcaster and author who frequently raves about the Illuminati, the legendary secret society aimed at global domination and populated by the alien reptiles.

When confronted about his screwy convictions, Icke said: “For 26 years I have taken untold f–king s–t and ridicule from people who don’t know their arse from their elbow. I didn’t and I don’t have any regrets!”

"Kim Kardashian: Nude Cookbook on the Way?!?

Not everyone is a fan of Kim Kardashian and/or the books she pretends to write.

Just the other day, some 74-year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of Kim's selfie-based memoir.

But we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray one's sticky seed all over its page.

If you know what we mean.

According to one of the funniest Radar Online stories we've read in awhile, Kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook.

Yes, a nude cookbook. As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.

We challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.

A video report on Radar claims that ""Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn't have any,"" adding by way of explanation:

""The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.""

This may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:

You don't need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you're a bit embarrassed to admit it.

But the answer to question number-two is revealed below:

Before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe's ""Rude Food.""

In that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.

An anonymous insider tells Radar that Kardashian is convinced ""her concept will succeed because she thinks she's in the best shape of her life after having two children.""

She does look pretty good at the moment, don't you think?

Last week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her ""generous cupcakes.""

By this, we assume the publication meant her ""very large breasts.""

For someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.

She could make the talk show rounds.

She could gain new social media followers.

She could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.

Moreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?

"Fossil Concedes the Smartwatch Trend is Over



Fossil Group is conceding defeat in its smartwatch line. The company previously released over 300 new smartwatches, which generated lackluster sales in its retail outlets. Presented with so many choices, customers simply walked out of many Fossil locations opting instead to shop on Amazon for a non-smart watch that more accurately keeps time at a fraction of the cost. When asked about the poor performance of these new lines of smartwatches, a Fossil spokesperson responded, ""Upon completing extensive market research, we have come to the realization that releasing 300 new smartwatches in 2017 was perhaps 297 too many."" Brands like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Fossil, Michael Kors, and Misfit were all impacted by the slump in smartwatch purchases. All of the watches ran the new Android Wear 2.0 operating system, and were powered by a Snapdragon Wear 2100 chip. Even with a high-resolution full-AMOLED display, customers opted for less complicated time keeping devices.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\tech012.fake.txt
"Billy Bush's wife is 'furious' at him after Trump interview leak

Billy Bush may have just posted a new selfie with his wife, but rumors are swirling that all is not well back in their California paradise.

The recently-fired Today Show host has moved back to Los Angeles after his now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood interview with Donald Trump was leaked.

But sources told Page Six that Sydney Davis, Bush's wife of 18 years, is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters.

'She was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while,' an NBC insider told the site. 'They are having marriage problems.'

In the tape, Bush can be heard calling actress Arianne Zucker 'hot as s***,' and also saying nothing while Trump makes lewd comments about his co-host Nancy O'Dell.

But the moment that really angered Davis, a source claims, was when Bush, after gawking at Zucker's legs, asked her if she would give him and the Donald 'a little hug'.

'It wasn't just the vile talk,' the source said. 'It's because he insisted the woman hug him and Trump. It was creepy.'

Bush, 45, later released an apology for the interview and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed', but did not make any mention of Davis.

'I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,' he said in the statement. 'I'm very sorry.'

The source said Davis is enraged that Bush 'was stupid enough to put himself in that position' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig.

'Billy has brought him on himself,' they said. 'He's blown his big chance at Today and he doesn't have his old job at Access [Hollywood] to fall back on.'

'He fears his career is over. His wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.'

Bush refused to comment on the article to Page Six, telling the site: 'I cannot take this call.'

Davis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on Saturday she did reappear on her husband's Instagram.

Bush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving The Today Show, posting a picture of him and Davis in the great outdoors.

'Hiking with lady long legs,' he wrote in the caption. 'Nice to get out.'

It was the first photo Bush, 45, had shared on Instagram in three weeks.

Davis features prominently in Bush's Instagram, most recently visiting him in New York with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal.

'Teaching the squad about the NYC Subway ONLY way to go,' Bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word 'squad'.

In another photo him and Davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo.

Bush, who worked at Access Hollywood for 15 years, had only held his new job at Today for two months when he was given the boot following the Trump scandal.

Matt Lauer confirmed Bush's contract had been terminated 'effective immediately' on an episode of the Today Show last week.

Lauer closed out by saying: 'All of us here at Today wish Billy the very best.'

Tamron Hall also acknowledged Bush's departure later in the show, saying: 'As a longtime member of the NBC family, we wish Billy all the best as he moves forward.'

Bush said in a statement following the announcement that he was 'deeply grateful' for the conversations he'd had with his three teenage daughters.

'I look forward to what lies ahead,' he added.

Although speculation has swirled regarding where Bush might go next - including to the rumored future Trump TV - he has not yet confirmed his next step.

Instead it seems Bush has been busy trying to return to life in Los Angeles, even putting up his luxury Manhattan townhouse on the market for $8.2million.

Bush had purchased the building for $8.8million just last December.

It was initially reported that Bush walked away from NBC with $10million, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate.

Instead it is believed NBC would only pay some of the remainder of Bush's $3million-a-year contract, according to CNN Money.

Exact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush can look for jobs at rivals stations.

Bush's attorney Marshall Grossman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the interview with Trump, saying that Bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at Trump's statements and made lewd comments of his own.

'If Billy had been passive or responded ""Shut the f*** up"" to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,' said Grossman.

But one source told the Daily Mail Online that Bush had bragged about the tape while covering the Olympics this summer in Rio.

'What is stunning is how self-important Billy is,' the source said.

'Many people believe Access Hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting Billy while not doing the right thing and informing NBC News.'",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\049fake.txt

"Car bomb kills eight at police academy in Bogotá
A car bomb has been detonated at a police academy in Bogotá, killing at least eight people and injuring 10 according to Colombian authorities.

The scene outside the General Santander police academy was chaotic, with ambulances and helicopters rushing to the normally tightly controlled facility.

Witnesses said they heard a loud explosion that destroyed windows in adjacent buildings. Pictures on social media showed a charred vehicle surrounded by debris on the academy’s campus.

President Iván Duque, who was visiting a western state, was rushing back to the capital to oversee police operations.

For decades, residents of Bogotá lived in fear of being caught in a bombing by leftist rebels or Pablo Escobar’s Medellín drug cartel. But as Colombia’s conflict has wound down, and the nation’s largest rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, security has improved and attacks have become less frequent.

Authorities have yet to suggest who was behind the attack, but attention has focused on leftist rebels from the National Liberation Army, which has been stepping up attacks on police targets in Colombia amid a standoff with the conservative Duque over how to re-start stalled peace talks.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\45.txt

Researchers at The Intelligence Institute, a conservative non-profit group, tested 5,000 people using a series of tests that measure everything from cognitive aptitude to common sense and found that people who identified themselves as Fox News viewers and 'conservative' had, on average, significantly lower intelligent quotients.

"An Indian Start-Up Made A Robot Receptionist: Of Course She's A Woman
By Gopal Sathe
BENGALURU, Karnataka — Mitri, the receptionist at Smartworks, a co-working space in Cessna Business Park on Bengaluru’s Outer Ring Road, wears pink and white, greets people with a fixed smile and patiently answers questions about the facility. 

She’s also being prepped to take over some janitorial work, vacuum floors and flit through the building at night as a security guard. 

Mitra, her male counterpart, by contrast is in training to be deployed at a car-dealership.

Mitri and Mitra are both robots — identical in every way except for their “genders”, as telegraphed by their plastic outer shells.

The rise of the robots is already up-ending the workplace, yet somethings remain depressingly familiar—such as creating robots that conform to the same old stereotypes of ‘authoritative’ men and ‘helpful’ women. It is no coincidence that three of the biggest virtual assistants today—Siri, Alexa, and Cortana—also sound like women.

“Initially, the bot was gender neutral,” explained Balaji Viswanathan, the CEO of Invento Robotics, the Bengaluru company that manufactures Mitra and Mitri.

Viswanathan, a fixture of the Bengaluru startup scene, said Invento started about two and a half years ago with the idea to build a humanoid assistant, and came up with the design based on how it would interact with people.

This included a ‘head’ that would turn to look at people (with mounted cameras), a display on its torso that would be easy to reach and type on, and a wheeled base for easy movement. What it didn’t include were any gender-related features.

“When we first made it, we called it Mitra, and it was gender neutral. People asked us, ‘why did you make it male?’ You shouldn’t read too much into the whole gender thing, it’s just more successful with the customers, but it’s the same,” explained Viswanathan.

“It has the same functionality. The design, like Mitri has a more curved design, the original design had more straight lines. And the colours, and voice, these are the main changes. It’s about what our customer thinks their customer will be most comfortable with,” Viswanathan said.
The result is a little disturbing though. Mitri might look more like a chess piece than a person, but it’s been given a woman’s voice. It will back up to move out of the way as you come close, and turn to look at you. So placing a touchscreen display right over its “chest” seems like a bad design choice, and leads to awkward-looking interactions.
What the customers want

Viswanathan said that Invento is seeing customers from a number of different spheres. Airports are one set of customers—Mumbai has two bots, Delhi has three, and Chennai also has two. As it happens, just before meeting Viswanathan, we came across a Mitra-bot at the Chennai airport. It was unfortunately powered down at the time, and employees nearby couldn’t give details about its use.

It’s also been deployed at SmartWorks, and other offices are in the pipeline, where it could use facial recognition to identify employees and buzz them through without requiring a tag or ID card. It could also, Viswanathan said, be used to give employees useful information through spoken queries, “Like, if you want to know how you should apply for leave, or what training you are eligible for, those kinds of things you could just ask.”

The bot is also being used at retail locations, including a car dealership which specifically asked for a ‘male’ design. “We don’t need to do much to switch so we’re not too hung up on calling it male-female, it’s just what the customers want,” Viswanathan said.

    Why a ‘female’ robot? — “It’s more woman-friendly.”

This was confirmed by Harsh Binani and Neetish Sarda, CEO and founder of Smartworks respectively. The co-working company wants to take care of everything an employee could need—from basics like Internet and food at the canteen, to BigBasket vending machines and a laundry service, SmartWorks wants to handle everything.

“We want to make the office and employee experience hassle-free, and Bengaluru has been very receptive,” said Binani. “But what’s also important to remember is that what is important to people in Bengaluru may not be very useful in Mumbai.” Bengaluru is a high-tech centre, he averred, and Sarda added that for the people here, a solution like Mitri seemed like the best option.

“We tried tablets, email-based systems, all of that, but this really clicked in our trial,” said Sarda. “Is the air conditioning uneven? Does the toilet need cleaning? Just tell Mitri, and it will send real-time updates to the building managers who can take action.”

The robot won’t be replacing a real receptionist, and Sarda said there’s no rationale to do so. But why a ‘female’ robot? “It’s more woman-friendly,” said Binani. “The office is full of tech companies, it’s very male dominated, so this makes it more approachable for the women working here.”
A history of gendered robots

The gender of robots, and AI assistants is not an idle question. It’s one of those things that gets taken for granted, but speaking in India, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella talked about AI being the new operating system. This is a matter of concern, because we often don’t understand how the systems we build will work, and interact. For example, Amazon’s hiring algorithm had to be scrapped because was biased against women, which went unnoticed for a long time.

And Microsoft’s chatbot Ruuh—which receives marriage proposals from strangers on Facebook, and chats with them about movies and music—quickly changes the subject if you talk about abuse or violence against women, rather than offering the resources people need. This isn’t a flaw in the bot, it’s just a scenario it’s creators didn’t think about.

This isn’t new—the first chat program was named Eliza, in the 1960s. In the intervening years, we’ve tended to label conversational bots and algorithms as female, and this has consequences. Researchers said that virtual assistants spend much of their time fending off sexual harassment.
Robots are developed with certain traits in accordance not only with who makes them, but also who the user is perceived as in terms of their gender roles, which adds to the social construct of robots’ gender roles, according to Roger Andre Søraa, in a paper titled “Mechanical genders: how do humans gender robots?”, published in Volume 21 of the “Gender, Technology and Development” journal.

Research showed that users tend to like a male voice when an authoritative presence is needed and a female voice when receiving helpful guidance. Viswanathan is right when he reiterates that robots don’t have genders. But the gender biases that we see in the human world are mirrored in the robots we’re creating. When the exact same robot is given a pastel shade and rounded head to make “her” a more welcoming receptionist, and broad shoulders and a deeper voice so “he” will be more effective as a watchman, it tells us something, not about the robots, but the people using them.
The next generation

At the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the biggest gadgets expo in the world, Invento is showcasing its latest robot, the Mitra v3. The new robot has more dextrous arms, and can even make hand gestures like a thumbs-up, or to hold small objects. The new bot will also have an updated navigation system, so it can move around the office (or showroom, or airport) more easily.

It’s also getting some additional software smarts for use in a retail environment. For example, the camera on its head will also be used as a barcode reader. This could be useful in stores, to give nutritional information or describe common recipes using those ingredients, for example.

Interestingly enough, the new version being demonstrated is the Mitra design again, and not the Mitri. The customers might prefer one thing but as Viswanathan puts it, “don’t think too much about the gender of a robot.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\21.txt

James Wan started filming for Aquaman in Australia last month. While Jason Momoa and Mera actress Amber Heard have already shot their first scene together, Queen Atlanna actress Nicole Kidman reached a few days ago. Following her landing, there have reportedly been feud sparks on the sets.

The actress, who will be seen playing Momoa's mother in the movie, recently shared that she was excited to take on the role of the female warrior, but it looks like she does not like Heard's presence on the sets.

Also Read: Is something brewing between Aquaman Jason Momoa & Nicole Kidman on sets of DC movie?

According to a report by National Enquirer, it seems like there is an epic clash in making. The report claims that Kidman is not treating Heard like others on the set. The website's source shares that she has been giving Heard a cold treatment since the pre-production stage. But why?

National Enquirer claims that it has to do with Heard's divorce with Kidman's dear friend Johnny Depp. ""Nicole didn't like how Amber treated [her friend] Johnny Depp during their divorce,"" the source told the outlet.

""It doesn't help that [Kidman] has little respect for Amber as an actress,"" or that her role in the movie is ""bigger"" than Kidman's. ""She thinks Amber's getting by on social climbing and good looks rather than talent,"" adds the report. The website's source also added that Heard's ""forceful personality"" will ""guaranteed snap"" when Kidman arrives on set.

However, Gossip Cop's shares that there is no truth in these claims. Debunking the bogus claim, the website assures that the news is indeed fake.

The gossip website reached out to the Big Little Lies star and her rep guaranteed that there is no truth in the made claims. They also write that another source from the Aquaman movie sets shares with them that there are no issues between the two actresses.

While that has ended the possible speculations, new video shared by Heard show how much she is working out and preparing for her scenes in the movie. In a boomerang video she shared on Instagram, the actress is seen cart-wheeling with her trainer on the sets.

Whereas, Jason Momoa is busy rock climbing as he shares more videos from his training camp.

In an effort to win Harry’s heart, Kendall has made it clear that she’s laying it all out on the line — her body that is — and wants the world to see. “Her friends are all talking about how she’s trying to impress Harry by flashing her boobs and wearing risque top,” a source told OK! exclusively. “She’s never gotten over Harry Styles, and would take him back in half a heartbeat if he showed even the faintest interest.”

With the successes of Dunkirk, it’s hard for Kendall to not fall in love with the singer/actor all over again, the insider said, “especially since they’ve crossed paths more than a few times recently and still have a ton of mutual friends.”

As for her current relationship, she isn’t going to let it stop her from sparking up that old flame. “She’s not that hot for A$AP, everyone knows it’s a relationship of convenience more than anything,” the source claimed. “He always said she was too prude, she wants to show she’s changed.”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\195fake.txt

"Harvey Weinstein plans to sue New York Times for $50M

Harvey Weinstein says he will sue the New York Times for an estimated $50 million after it published a bombshell report claiming the movie mogul subjected actresses and female staffers to “decades of sexual harassment.”

Weinstein has hired Charles J. Harder — the LA attorney who brought down Gawker after winning a $140 million verdict for Hulk Hogan after the site posted a sex tape — to go after the Times, which posted its blistering exposé on the Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul Thursday.

Harder said in a statement on behalf of Weinstein, exclusively given to Page Six, “The New York Times published today a story that is saturated with false and defamatory statements about Harvey Weinstein. It relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by 9 different eyewitnesses. We sent the Times the facts and evidence, but they ignored it and rushed to publish. We are preparing the lawsuit now. All proceeds will be donated to women’s organizations.”

Harder did not say how much they planned to sue for, but sources said Weinstein would go after the publication for as much as $50 million.

Weinstein denies the accounts given by several female former employees to the Times, as well as details given by actress Ashley Judd, who says the mogul lured her up to his hotel room, where she alleged he appeared in a bathrobe and asked her to massage him or watch him shower.

The Times also reported that the powerful co-founder of Miramax negotiated at least eight payouts to women to keep them quiet, by asking them to sign confidentiality agreements barring them from speaking about the alleged harassment.

In a statement Thursday to The Post through attorney Lisa Bloom, Weinstein said, “I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it’s not an excuse, in the office — or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.”

"How Buzz Aldrin's communion on the moon was hushed up
As Neil Armstrong's memorial takes place, it's good to remember why Nasa kept Aldrin's surreal lunar ceremony under wraps
Before Armstrong and Aldrin stepped out of the lunar module on July 20, 1969, Aldrin unstowed a small plastic container of wine and some bread. He had brought them to the moon from Webster Presbyterian church near Houston, where he was an elder. Aldrin had received permission from the Presbyterian church's general assembly to administer it to himself. In his book Magnificent Desolation he shares the message he then radioed to Nasa: ""I would like to request a few moments of silence … and to invite each person listening in, wherever and whomever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours, and to give thanks in his or her own way.""

He then ate and drank the elements. The surreal ceremony is described in an article by Aldrin in a 1970 copy of Guideposts magazine: ""I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.""
He also read a section of the gospel of John. During it all, Armstrong, reportedly a deist, is said to have watched respectfully but without making any comment.
The story of the secret communion service only emerged after the mission. Aldrin had originally planned to share the event with the world over the radio. However, at the time Nasa was still reeling from a lawsuit filed by the firebrand atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair, resulting in the ceremony never being broadcast. The founder of American Atheists and self-titled ""most hated woman in America"" had taken on Nasa, as well as many other public organisation. Most famously, she successfully fought mandatory school prayer and bible recitation in US public schools.

After the Apollo 8 crew had read out the Genesis creation account in orbit, O'Hair wanted a ban on Nasa astronauts practising religion on earth, in space or ""around and about the moon"" while on duty. She believed it violated the constitutional separation between church and state. In Magnificent Desolation, Aldrin explains how astronaut Deke Slayton, who ran the Apollo 11 flight crew operations, told him to tone down his lunar communiqué. ""Go ahead and have communion, but keep your comments more general,"" he advised. Looking back Aldrin writes that the communion was his way of thanking God for the success of the mission. Yet, later he hinted that he could have been more inclusive.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\40.txt

"Leah Remini Opens Up About Her Friendship With Jennifer Lopez And The Scientology Connection

Jennifer Lopez and ex-Scientologist Leah Remini are the best of friends. They have known each other for several years and have been through a lot. Come what may, their friendship weathers through. It has always seemed that Leah was the only one with a Church of Scientology connection, but that isn’t the case.

In a recent interview with People, Leah Remini shared how her friend Jennifer Lopez fits into the Scientology equation. While Jennifer isn’t a member of the Church of Scientology herself, her father David is. He has been in the church for over 30 years. When Leah left the Church of Scientology, she was lucky that her husband Angelo Pagan, her daughter Sofia, and her mother Vicky all came with her. A topic she has covered on her A&E Emmy-nominated show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, is “disconnecting.”

When a member of the Church of Scientology decides to leave the religion, their friends and family that are still in the church are no longer to have contact with them. This is called disconnecting. Now, while the church’s rebuttal is that no one is forced to disconnect and that it is a choice, viewers of her show understand how serious disconnection is taken.

Leah shared that actually, her friend Jennifer Lopez could be in danger of disconnection for remaining her friend. The way the Church of Scientology believes, David Lopez, being an active member, should disconnect from Jennifer because of her continuing connection to Leah. She did imply that it is enforced more for members who are not such “big names.” Considering she left the Church of Scientology in 2013, it appears there have been no repercussions for their friendship.

The Church of Scientology took offense to her observations and responded by bashing Leah’s show where she takes on the church. The few times the church has responded to Leah Remini, it has always been to refute all claims their ex-believer has made. They say she is lying, staging the show, and all other ex-members who are on her show are just as dishonest. Leah remains dedicated to exposing the church and the leaders.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\112fake.txt
"Robert Pattinson Finally Has Successful Movie - Twilight Curse Over? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Robert Pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film, “Good Time”. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. There is also Oscar buzz surrounding Robert, with some speculating he could receive a Best Actor nomination.

In the gritty, crime film, Robert portrays a criminal named Connie Nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. Robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. The star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in New York without anyone knowing who he was.

When the film premiered recently at Cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting “Bravo” and many came up to Robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. Critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for Robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office.

Of course everyone knows Robert’s big break came with the 2008 film, “Twilight” where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, Edward Cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. The “Twilight” movies became a billion dollar franchise, making Robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. While he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in Hollywood and almost ruined his career.

For the past few year, Robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, “Remember Me” and mostly forgettable indie films. Some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the “Twilight Curse”.

Since the ending of the “Twilight” and it’s sequels in 2012, most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. Taylor Lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, “Abduction”, he disappeared from Hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with “Scream Queens”.

Other actors from the movie franchise, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson Rathbone have also had trouble finding success after “Twilight” with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-DVD movie.

Kristen Stewart, who portrayed Bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married “Snow White and the Huntsman” director.

With the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, I’m sure Robert Pattinson is glad his “Twilight Curse” appears to be over.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\227fake.txt
"They called him ‘Mr Big.’ When he was killed by a hit man named ‘The Iceman,’ a gang war erupted.

Around town, they call him “Mr. Big,” but the nickname does not square with the man stepping out of his silver BMW around 7:30 p.m. on July 26, 2015.

Paul Massey is slight and unassuming, reportedly just 5-foot-8, his balding hair shaved tight, his face lined like a deflated football. As always, he’s simply dressed. A proud son of these working-class streets in Salford, a city west of Manchester, England, he likes to boast he’s never worn a suit in his life. His nickname is tied to a kind of stature not measured by inches or appearance.

He is clutching a bag from his local Bargain Booze, the Manchester Evening News would later report. Inside are his usual Sunday evening drinks — Bacardi rum and Coca-Cola. But before the 55-year-old enters his home, gunfire snaps and Massey goes down.

The shooter is wearing military-style fatigues. He steps over the smashed glass and spilled rum to where Massey has crumpled, unleashing another blast from the Uzi before melting away into the neighborhood.

Bleeding from 18 bullet holes, the fingers of his right hand blown off, Massey manages to make a phone call for help. But he dies at the scene. As word quickly races through Salford, friends and associates pour in behind the blue police tape, a flash vigil for the city’s “Mr. Big.”

Massey’s nickname stemmed from his influence in Salford’s criminal underworld, a scene of hoodlums and scammers with cartoonish monikers — such as “The Psycho” and “Cazza” — belying violent streaks. For decades, Massey was the elder statesman among Manchester’s crooks, a self-styled, street-tough Robin Hood who once leveraged his reputation in an unsuccessful bid for Salford’s mayor’s office.

“I could be shot dead anytime”, Massey once reflected to a film crew. “That’s the end of it. I am prepared to face that — I know the stakes . . . [but] I pity the b-----d who did it after.”

According to prosecutors, Massey’s assassination was the first domino to fall in a gangland war between former members of an organized local crime outfit known as the A Team. The beef would continue to leave blood on the streets in the years after Massey’s death.

This week, 38-year-old Mark Fellows was convicted of murdering both Massey and one of his top associates as part of the bloody feud, the Guardian reported. The verdict Wednesday closes the curtain on a criminal saga with Shakespearean echoes of honor and betrayal that also seems ripped from the tawdriest pulp fiction. Among Salford’s underworld, Fellows was known as “The Iceman.”

Salford’s “Mr. Big” grew up in a tough part of town, according to a 2015 report by the BBC. At 12, he first crossed law enforcement when he was arrested for damaging an empty house. The charge landed him in a reform school. According to the BBC, Massey later spoke of “bitterness against the system” for being “dragged away from his mother and father.”

“He had a strong anti-authority streak,” Peter Walsh, the author of “Gang War: The Inside Story of the Manchester Gangs,” told the BBC. “He wasn’t the biggest, he wasn’t the toughest, but he was quite charismatic and very principled in his own way.”

In the ’80s, when Manchester became internationally renowned as the ground zero for rave parties, Massey and his friends spotted an opening. The crew allegedly took over working the doors at the city’s popular clubs. Then, “they started smuggling ecstasy in from Holland and selling that” to ravers, Walsh claimed.

The “Mr. Big” nickname was coined by a city official at a 1992 public meeting decrying the lack of exposure of the criminals running wild in the streets. “Massey, ‘Mr. Big,’ why don’t the press print his name?” the official said, the Evening News has reported.

The name stuck. Massey would allegedly later be involved in numerous criminal schemes, ranging from burglary rings to protection rackets, according to the Evening News. But he also cultivated the image of a man fighting for his community. Massey allegedly outlawed heroin sales in Salford while he was in control.

In 1999, Massey was convicted of stabbing a man in the groin outside a nightclub. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Upon his early release in 2007, Massey’s reputation remained large on the streets. In 2012, he ran for mayor of Salford. “I don’t want to be known as Mr. Big. I don’t want a reputation,” he told the Telegraph at the time. “I just want to be me — people have got me wrong.”

He came in seventh out of 10 candidates in the election.

By the 2010s, Massey was a father of five and a grandfather of eight. He claimed he was a legitimate business owner, running a number of security operations. According to the Evening News, his direct influence over criminal operations in Salford had allegedly waned. But he still commanded respect among the younger generation of Manchester-area crews, and was known to broker peace agreements between squabbling factions before arguments turned violent.

But the implosion of the area’s most powerful gang, the A Team, would allegedly lead to Massey’s murder.

In 2014, the A Team snapped into two factions, the Evening News reported. Police allege the divide was the result of a rowdy evening at a nightclub resulting in a woman throwing a drink in a A Team member’s face. The paper also cites “gangland sources” who source the split from when a gang member learned the Breitling watch he had bought from another member was fake.

Whatever the reason for the acrimony, a year before Massey’s death, the gang members were at odds. The original faction of A Team members were led by a close confidant of Massey’s, police testified at the recent trial. The break-off element was known as the Anti-A Team or the AA Team.

Massey was allegedly stuck between the two.

If “Mr. Big” Massey occupied the top floor of Salford’s crime world, “The Iceman” Fellows was stuck in the basement — a gangland “nobody,” according to the Evening News.

An illness growing up had left him with a colostomy bag for life, and he was fussy about both cleanliness and his health. A long-distance runner, he participated in grueling events like the Great Manchester Run, a Garmin Forerunner GPS watch strapped to his wrist tracking his distance and health stats.

According to prosecutors, Fellows aligned himself with the Anti-A Team crew following the dispute. He was allegedly paid 10,000 pounds (almost $13,000) to take out Massey. He reportedly spied on the underworld figure with a night-vision scope. He struck on July 26, 2015.

Massey’s death stunned Salford. His coffin was pulled through the streets in a horse-drawn hearse. A pipe band played in the procession. Flower arrangements shaped like cannabis leaves and big cigarettes were laid out. Gangland figures from across the United Kingdom sent tributes.

The death also sparked violent retributions between the A Team and Anti-A Team. Bullets tore into house fronts. Machetes were swung. Smoke grenades were rolled into wedding ceremonies.

“I’ve never known crime at these levels, the number of incidents in a short space of time,” City Councillor Paul Wilson told the Guardian in 2015. “These are targeted attacks but my fear is that an innocent person will get caught up in it.”

Police struggled to identify Massey’s killer. According to the Evening News, at one point investigators complied a list of 112 gangland suspects. Fellows was also suspected, but no evidence tied him to the hit.

The case ground on for three more years. Then, on May 5, 2018, a second murder struck Massey’s inner circle.

That morning, John Kinsella, a 53-year-old judo and jujitsu expert who was a allegedly a close gangland associate of Massey’s and had served as a pallbearer at his funeral, took a walk with his pregnant girlfriend across a footpath in a village called Rainhill. The couple brought along their six American bulldogs.

As Kinsella struggled to pull along a dog that was straying behind, Fellows huffed up on a mountain bike, prosecutors allege. He shot Kinsella twice in the back with a Webley revolver, then two more times from close range before pedaling away.

According to the Evening News, police immediately turned on Fellows as a possible suspect in both killings based on the similar execution of both crimes.

During a raid on his apartment, police discovered Fellows’s Garmin Forerunner GPS watch. The data from the watch placed Fellows at the scene of Massey’s murder. A picture of the suspect wearing the watch at the Great Manchester Run put the item in his possession at the time of the killing.

Both Fellows and an associate and A Team member named Steven Boyle, 36, were charged with both Massey’s and Kinsella’s murder, as well as the attempted murder of Kinsella’s girlfriend. Prosecutor’s alleged Boyle acted as a spotter for Fellows during the hits, the BBC reported.

On Wednesday, following a six-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court, Fellows was found guilty of both murders. Boyle was convicted of Kinsella’s murder but acquitted in Massey’s death. Both were found not guilty of attempted murder of Kinsella’s girlfriend. The men are scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. They face mandatory life sentences.

After the verdicts, Louise Lydiate, Massey’s longtime partner and mother of two of his children, briefly addressed reporters.

“Anyone who knows Paul would tell you he was a very generous, kind man who would do anything for anybody,” she said of the late “Mr. Big.” “All these Mr. Big . . . things like that come from people who obviously don’t know him.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\46.txt

"Jennifer Aniston Doubts Justin Bieber Is The Right Man For Selena Gomez

A changed man that is what Justin Bieber is claiming to be, but it appears that Jennifer Aniston is not sure he is telling the truth.

It is a well-known fact that Aniston and Selena Gomez are good friends. According to well-placed sources, Aniston sees the Texan singer and actress as a daughter.

The person close to Brad Pitt’s former wife claimed that she is disappointed in Gomez’s decision to go back to the Canadian star who previously broke her heart.

The source, which spoke to OK!, claimed that Aniston does not want Gomez to get hurt again and she fears Bieber might cause trouble again.

If the story is accurate, Aniston will have to accept Gomez’s new romance because the pair plans to move in together.

A source spoke to People and claimed: “They are great and very happy.It just got too crazy last week with all the attention. Justin canceled his tour to take care of his mental health, and he wants to continue to focus on this. He did not like the chaos. They agreed to stay more low-key. It was Selena’s idea, and Justin is all for it. He is already looking at homes in the Calabasas, CA area. They just can’t wait to start their life together.”

The tipster added: “Their first home together is the beginning of what they hope will be a very long life together. They have both grown up so much. Being apart was crucial for them to move on and to realize they were meant to be together. Ultimately, buying a home to live in as a couple will seal the deal.”

A second insider told Hollywood Life that Bieber is more mature and he is taking it slow with Gomez to make sure this time around they finish as husband and wife.

The same source confessed that Gomez is proud of the improvements and changes Bieber has made to his life.

The pal shared: “Selena is blown away by Justin’s new integrity. Since they have reunited, Justin now keeps every promise he makes and is doing everything he says he is going to do.

"'Jessie J's 100% gay ... but bi is more trendy'

POP beauty Jessie J is 100 per cent lesbian, an explosive book claims.

The Voice judge, 24, was ordered to hide the truth by record bosses to avoid

 turning off male fans, the unauthorised biography says.

They advised the star to say she was a bisexual who liked boys AND

 girls, because that was trendy.

But the sensational book alleges the singer-songwriter has not had a

 boyfriend since realising she was a lesbian at 17.

The book, Jessie J: Who's Laughing Now, says Jessie took the advice of music

 executives because she was scared of losing her Universal record deal.

Author Chloe Govan says: ""Jessie might have been with boys in the past - but

 she is 100 per cent gay. Jessie was openly lesbian and didn't hide it.

""She was advised not to come out, though. Certain people thought being bi was

 trendy, exotic and a fashion statement. It would increase her allure.

""Being gay would alienate people. They knew how important image was and asked

 her to tone it down a bit.

""There are so many homophobes out there, they feared a career-damaging

 backlash.""

Jessie - who admits fancying fellow singer Rihanna - is said to have been

 ""incensed"" at having to compromise.

She said in a recent interview: ""If I meet someone and I like them, I don't

 care if they're a boy or a girl.""

The book, out today, also talks about Jessie's battles with her health and

 bullying she faced.

When she was 11 she learned she had the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White

 syndrome. It can speed up the heart rate to four times normal.

Jessie had a stroke aged 18 but never let her illness get in the way of her

 ambitions.

She even took ballet lessons while wearing a heart monitor.

She was also prescribed beta blockers - but was picked on when their side

 effects turned her pale skin a greenish tinge.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\054fake.txt
"Tom Hiddleston Stunned Taylor Swift Referenced Him On New Album: Here’s Why

While most of the people who are or were in Taylor Swift’s life most likely knew they’d be called out on her album, Tom Hiddleston thought he was safe! But, is ex mentioned him in TWO tracks! Here’s what he thinks …


Tom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, “Reputation“. But, come on, Tom; anyone’s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks — “I Did Something Bad” and “Getaway Car”. And, since the pair didn’t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would’ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.

“Tom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor’s album,” a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “He thought they were on good terms,” our insider says, adding, “After their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone’s saying she did and he’s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.” Well, maybe next time, Tom.

As soon as Taylor’s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here’s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, “I Did Something Bad”, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a “narcissist” who “talks sh-t.” Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a “playboy” who she flew “around the world” with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.

The second Tom reference on “Reputation” came on the track, “Getaway Car”, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn’t have a “reason.” Then, when she goes to an event where “the ties were black and the lights were white,” she found her reason — a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala… the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn’t work out, and that the person [Tom] should’ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.

Taylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue‘s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.

"What Sort of Diva Demands Does Mariah Carey Have for ‘American Idol’?

We still can't get over the fact that the No. 1 diva herself Mariah Carey has agreed to be a judge on ' American Idol .' Of course, with a price tag of $18 million, we're not terribly surprised, but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like ' X Factor ' judge Britney Spears and ' The Voice ' judge Christina Aguilera .

Carey has carried the label ""diva"" with her for years, so the 'Idol' staff is doing the only thing they can at the moment: preparing. Her backstage rider has previously consisted of outrageous demands, so it's no wonder staffers are bracing themselves for Carey's arrival. Let's take a look at some of her previous requests:

Done scratching your head yet? Okay. But the following may be most shocking of all: a source close to the singer said Carey won't require anything out of the ordinary for 'Idol.' Whaaaaaaaaat?  ""It’s all standard stuff, nothing out of the ordinary,""  said the source. ""It’s not like they’ll need to put a new roof on the building. It’s standard lists, whether it’s for water, soda, veggies, snacks. It’s all fairly normal.""

Perhaps motherhood is having big impact on Carey's not-so-divalike behavior? Who can think about a frolicking in a mountain of kittens when you have two crying toddlers to take care of? And since the show has ""its own branded requirements for stars to use the products of certain sponsors,"" maybe her demands will be kept at an all-time low!",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\208fake.txt

"Miley Cyrus Wedding Rumors: Will Miley Force Liam Hemsworth To Sign A Prenup?

Wedding rumors for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are heating up, and now many fans want to know if either party plans to protect their assets before tying the knot. Miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her Aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants Liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. Life & Style has reported that Miley's money demands have caused stress in her relationship with Liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary.

Miley Cyrus is worth a whopping $160 million while Liam boasts just $16 million himself. Life & Style claims that Miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $176 million as they head toward marriage. Apparently, it doesn't matter to Miley if everything about her relationship with Liam seems perfect right now. Cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in 2013. Miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with Liam doesn't stand the test of time.

""They've had heated arguments over this,"" a source told the magazine. ""He's a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it's not needed. He's assured Miley he isn't interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own.""

It's only fair that Miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry Liam. Cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make Hemsworth happy. It was Miley's wild ways that pushed Liam away the first time around. Now that Liam and Miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and Miley isn't acting out nearly as much as she was in past years.

On the other hand, Liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, Miley is the woman that he loves. While Miley has toned it down some, Liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self.

After reports that Miley moved in with Liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. Us Magazine reports that Miley just put $2.5 million down on a 4-bedroom home in Malibu. ""The plan is for Liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he's ready,"" a source close to Cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. It's unclear why Miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with Liam, not far away. Now, the pair own a pair of Malibu homes. Could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together 24 hours a day?

So far, neither Miley nor Liam are talking about their reconciliation. Then again, they aren't hiding their love either. Ever since Miley was spotted in Australia during the New Year's holiday, she and Liam have been seen spending time together. There have even been reports that mutual friend Kellan Lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about Liam purchasing a new ring for Miley. Not to mention that Cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on Instagram already.

Will the prenup continue to be an issue for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth? Fans hope not and many are excited that Miley has her man back. Let's just hope this new Miley is still fun and outrageous, and that Liam doesn't tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\009fake.txt

"Ansel Adams in a New Light
By Vicki Goldberg
BOSTON — Ah, wilderness! It’s our answer to Europe’s cathedrals, our proof of a unique national identity.

Most citizens were first introduced to the wilderness by images. In the early 19th century, Thomas Cole placed the eastern wilderness — his beloved Catskill Mountains — on walls. Later in the century, Carleton Watkins’s 1861 photographs of Yosemite contributed heavily to Lincoln’s decision in 1864 to secure the valley forever “for public use, resort and recreation,” the first time any government anywhere set aside land to benefit the public.

William Henry Jackson’s 1871 photographs of Yellowstone helped persuade Congress to establish the first national park in 1872. Then in the 1930s, Ansel Adams (1902-1984), a staunch conservationist who had grown up near the windswept dunes of Golden Gate Park, lobbied Congress and sent the government a book of his photographs of the southern Sierra Nevada range. They strongly influenced President Franklin Roosevelt’s decision to make the Kings Canyon area a national park.

Late in the century virtually every home had a viewer for 3-D stereographs of a West that looked like a fable. Manifestly — in mind-set as well as mission — the West was our destiny.

And now it is bracing — if perhaps cautionary — to see, close to the moment that the government shutdown has affected many of the national parks, so many noble and challenging images of our country’s heritage starring in “Ansel Adams in Our Time,” at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It is a far-ranging, smartly and instructively installed show of more than 100 of his photographs.

Not a mere retrospective, it also includes about 80 images by 23 contemporary photographers that the curator, Karen Haas, sees as a modern lens on Adams. Although the connections are occasionally a bit tenuous, their addition highlights how Adams, who carried the 19th century’s hymn to America into the 20th century, has remained an inescapable force.

The photographers on view who adapt Adams’s images simultaneously make radical changes and commentaries. Their inclusion points out major shifts in the way both landscape photography and landscape itself are now regarded.

Although Adams gave his heart to the 19th century, he trained his eye on modernism and the “straight photography” of the 1930s, with its sharp focus, vivid contrast and compositions that amounted to studies in form and light. His iconic and still breathtaking mountainscapes of Yosemite and elsewhere are on view, as well as such semiabstract landscapes as “Sand Dunes, Sunrise, Death Valley National Monument, California,” which could stand comfortably beside an Edward Weston.

Most come from the Lane Collection, a munificent gift of more than 450 Adams photographs to the M.F.A. There are surprises too, like the breadth of Adams’s interests (and the extent of his need to earn a living with commissions and magazine work), from Native Americans to ghost towns, from a World War II Japanese internment camp to cemeteries, churches, a cigar store Indian, a highway interchange.

Stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

Like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Adams experienced a heightened spirituality in the wilderness that spoke to a longing for the beauties, peace and spectacle of untrammeled nature — a yearning that lingers strongly in our time, suggesting it might be innate.

He was 14 when he first visited Yosemite. He quickly took his Kodak into that stupendous valley and was so moved by the experience that it changed his life. Adams meant his images to convey the emotions he experienced while taking pictures and then heightening their impact in the darkroom. (He was a superb printer.) How lucky it is for the arts that human vision, though it does not register the world in black and white, can respond to colorless representation on a level within reach of its response to color.

Landscape tourism grew exponentially from the post Civil War years to today, but untouched wilderness has dwindled as the population increased and migrated to cities and suburbs, while mining, drilling and industrialization encroached on open spaces. Adams, though well aware of how commercialized the national parks had become, could scarcely have anticipated that on summer weekends the grounds bordering the Grand Canyon would look like Woodstock.

He preferred the parks pristine, and Eadweard J. Muybridge’s 19th-century photograph of Yosemite Valley with a logging road cutting across it is paired at the M.F.A. with Adams’s image of the same place, the road carefully retouched out.

Photographers took note of how “progress” had changed the land. In the 1960s and 1970s, the movement called New Topographics signaled a radical shift from traditional depictions of the land to the many ways we had altered it.

Robert Adams, Lewis Baltz and others photographed what had once been purple mountains’ majesty — mountains now more likely to tower above rutted lanes and ticky-tacky houses. Adams took some note as well. His photograph of a housing development is at the M.F.A., as is his picture of a pensive cemetery statue that makes it clear that the cemetery borders on a forest — of oil derricks.

The New Topographers were determined to acknowledge the slow decline of wilderness, which had been trampled in part by the lingering wish to be near nature, a wish that bit its own tail. Many of the houses destroyed by the recent Northern California fires were located in what’s called the wildland-urban interface, dangerously close to forests.

In the late 1970s, a group called the Rephotographic Project figured out exactly where and in what season some important 19th-century landscape photographers had stood, then made photographs at the exact same times and places. The landscape, often enough, was quite recognizable but equally often overrun or partially obstructed by buildings.

Nonetheless, art and commercial photographers today still photograph beautiful landscapes beautifully. Landscape photographs are everywhere, thanks to Instagram, providing proof that wilderness still exists, although it may be outnumbered by its portraits.

SOME CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHERS ask a vital question of art history: What can be done with a scene that long ago became an icon and is tattooed upon our minds? The answer lies with what artists have done with icons for centuries: They have reinterpreted them.

Mark Klett and Byron Wolfe incorporated pieces of earlier photographs into their own collaboration on exhibit here, stitching a time sequence into a single image. They photographed the view from Glacier Point overlook at exactly the spot where Carleton Watkins had stood, then replaced portions of their color photograph with a fragment of Adams’s and a fragment of Watkins’s photographs of the same view.

Catherine Opie takes highly colored, out-of-focus pictures of Adams’s territory in the national parks. In a video at the exhibition she said that she wants people to know what they are looking at but to question it, an act of witnessing that one click on an iPhone, one glance at social media, does not create.

Abelardo Morell converted a dark, sealed tent into a camera obscura. An image of what an attached periscope saw was projected through its angled mirror onto the tent’s ground. He then photographed that underfoot image and printed it just as it was, showcasing America the beautiful through smatters and tatters of grass and dirt, as if the soles of our shoes had risen up to insist they were as essential to viewing as the view itself.

Binh Danh took daguerreotypes of Yosemite, a reversal of time and history. Daguerreotypes, made without a negative, are unique. They were introduced in 1839, never widely used for landscapes, and largely replaced by a negative process by the time Watkins photographed Yosemite in 1861. Their surface is reflective, so Binh Danh’s viewers see themselves looking at images of iconic places that they themselves are in.

Other contemporaries report on the many lasting changes human hands have made on the landscape. Mark Ruwedel photographs the tunnels and cuts that railroads long ago carved through the West at terrible cost and later abandoned — useless paths to nowhere slicing across the land.
Mitch Epstein’s “Altamont Pass Wind Farm” suggests that human interference has reached an implausible level. The wind farm sits in a barren desert, but where the windmills end a glistening green golf course begins, equipped with a concrete lane for golf carts. Where did, where does, the water come from? And the dirt? It may be ironic to plunk an entire course down beside a sand trap, but the 19th-century idea that God meant us to tame and reconfigure the land for our use did not have this in mind.

David Emitt Adams also photographs a deranged landscape, printing tintypes (another 19th-century process) of landscape details onto sculptures he made of old, beat-up, discarded metal cans he collected in the desert, where they pepper the ground. A new role for the desert: prime dump.

Though Adams remains extravagantly popular and landscape photographers across America and the world continue to provide us with luscious images, probably the largest number of landscape photographs people see, on television, the web, on mobile and in newspapers, are images of environmental destruction that is at least partially due to climate change: flooded beaches, rivers, towns, and islands, shrinking glaciers, forest fires feeding on drought, hurricane damage of cities and fields. All scientific predictions say this will grow worse unless strong action is taken soon.

Beautiful landscapes are good for the eye, the mind, the spirit.

One day images of them may be all that we have left.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\37.txt

"World Gun Violence Has Been Reportedly Declining Since Apple’s Gun Emoji Change In 2016
WORLDWIDE – According to world health reports, worldwide gun violence has been steadily declining since Apple replaced the gun emoji with a water gun back in August 2016 for ios 10.
According to researchers, there was a steady increase in worldwide gun violence since the 1970s, peaking at 251,000,000 in 2015. However in 2016, with the change of Apples gun emoji to a water gun, worldwide gun violence has been on an unprecedented decline, with only 900 gun related crimes in 2017, and an all time low of only 5 gun related crimes so far in 2018. Gun violence has almost disappeared completely thanks to Apple.
“Thank God for apple”, says Tom Gill of the American Medical Association, “who would’ve known that the key to a better world was just an emoji change away”.

The insider assured us that Kylie, who is expecting her first baby with boyfriend Travis Scott, is much more scared than what she lets the fans see.

‘She doesn’t know how to be an adult, let alone a mother. She is feeling so alone!’ the source added.

And while Kylie has been craving her mom’s care and help through this confusing change, Kris is reportedly way too busy to give Kylie the attention she needs.

In addition, Kris was planning to offer her youngest daughter a big spin-off show about her life as a young mother as well as an awesome pregnancy reveal but Kylie is getting way too impatient of staying hidden after so many years of enjoying the spotlight.

"Immigration Controversy Could Drive Up College Costs


The University of Central Missouri is one of many higher-education institutions to express support for its Muslim students after President Donald Trump's executive order restricting travel by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

Like many of the rest, it has reasons for feeling apprehensive that are not solely about empathy.

The university hosted more than 3,700 international students last year, most of them paying full tuition that helps subsidize domestic students.

"Michelle Obama’s Plastic Surgery Scandal!

Her vanity comes before our vets! In a slap in the face to America’s courageous wounded warriors, First Lady MICHELLE OBAMA used Walter Reed Army Medical Center as her own personal outpatient plastic surgery clinic, The National ENQUIRER has learned.

“It’s appalling!” fumed Jill Farrell of Judicial Watch. “With taxpayers picking up the tab for her ski trips to Aspen and beach outings to Hawaii, we might as well pay for her abs and butt, too!”

Michelle was whisked to the hospital with “the utmost secrecy” in the summer of 2011, a source told The ENQUIRER.

“Secret Service agents were stationed both inside and outside the operating room. Michelle had fat sucked from her abdomen, hips and butt.”

While such procedures can take up to two hours, “she was done in 45 minutes to an hour.”

What’s more, the source added, “When elective surgery is done, even if it’s cosmetic, the surgeon’s fee is waived. If Michelle paid anything, it would have been just for the anesthesiologist.

“Because Michelle is First Lady though, I wouldn’t be surprised if the government picked up the total tab, meaning taxpayers forked over their hard-earned dollars to satisfy her vanity!”

The ENQUIRER has also learned Michelle, 51, has likely had more than just liposuction at such military facilities.

We asked a panel of top plastic surgeons to analyze before-and-after photos of the First Lady, and each agreed the mother of two has undergone a so-called “liquid facelift” with Botox and filler injections, plus a nose job!

“A little Botox helps to smooth out those forehead lines earned during the last campaign,” theorized Dr. Lyle Back. “I can [also] see the rhinoplasty work she had done is very obvious. It is superb, sophisticated work, though.”

Dr. Otto Placik said Michelle now has fewer crow’s feet, indicating she’s had “definite Botox,” as well as a Hollywood-ready smile.

He added: “Her lips are fuller, indicating fillers into both upper and lower lips. Besides that, her marionette lines [running down from the corners of her mouth] are almost completely gone.”

Respected plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Dayan added: “She has a decrease in the height of her smile, which can happen when a lot of filler is placed in the cheeks and smile lines.”

The experts’ conclusions further incensed Jill, who charged: “Michelle Obama is taking up needed space while veterans are awaiting care and suffering. It’s a crying shame!”",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\148fake.txt

Newstalk.com reports: Gibson said that he hopes there will be a positive outcome for victims of sexual harassment or assault who are now coming forward.

He said: “I think a lot of light’s being shined into a lot of dark places right now – and rightfully so.

“It’s tragic in a sense, because a lot of the poor victims have to relive it. [It’s] torturous for them – but they’ll get free by re-examining it.”

"Brad Pitt Is Running Back to Jen Aniston During His Divorce From Angelina Jolie (EXCLUSIVE)

As Angelina Jolie continues to twist the knife in Brad Pitt's heart amid their impending divorce, the 53-year-old actor is running back to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston for support, In Touch has exclusively learned. A year after Angelina, 42, blindsided her husband of two years with divorce papers, the actress got candid with The New York Times, seemingly suggesting that her six children are better off without their father.

""[They're] the best friends I ever had,"" Angelina said of her children Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. ""Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.""

Aside from shading her ex-husband for his lack of support, Angelina also subtly implied that the kids are doing just fine, even without Brad. ""None of it's easy,"" she continued. ""It's very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy. They're getting better.""

Angelina's public talk of their marriage's demise and smearing of his parenting skills and reputation is enough to send Brad right into the arms of his ex, 48-year-old Friends star Jen. Though she married fellow actor Justin Theroux in 2015, Brad's former wife of nearly five years seems willing to be there for her ex-husband.

""[He] wants and needs Jen in his life,"" a source tells In Touch exclusively, ""especially during this trying time."" Justin, 46, isn't worried or the least bit threatened of Jen's friendship with her former beau. ""Brad wouldn't dream of breaking up Jen's marriage,"" the source reveals. ""Brad's leaning on her as a confidante now. His renewed friendship with Jen has been a huge source of support and comfort through the toughest year of his life.""

""Overall, Brad and Jen have a great deal in common,"" another source says, ""and have reached a level of closeness and understanding that they never thought was possible.""But not everyone is comfortable with Brad and Jen's newfound kinship. Angelina has reportedly gotten wind of Brad's new confidante and is none too happy.

""She's furious,"" a source reveals of Angelina's reaction. ""Jen's always been Angelina's greatest rival when it comes to Brad. She hates the way that she has always been depicted as the evil femme fatale and Jen as the girl-next-door victim in the famous love triangle.""

Meanwhile, Jen is allegedly reveling in Angelina's sour reaction. ""She's getting her well-deserved revenge,"" says the source. ""Jen feels Angelina lorded her relationship with Brad over her all these years. Jen's having the last laugh. She loves the fact she has become his confidante.""

Exactly how Brad won over Jen as a friend is no real mystery. Earlier this year, he revealed his excessive binge-drinking to GQ — ""I was boozing too much,"" he said at the time — and has since decided to quit drinking and issue apologies to all those he wronged. Seeing as Jen ""was the person highest on his apology list,"" as the source says, he called her last June and offered his sincere regrets.

""Brad flat-out apologized for all the heartache and pain he caused by leaving her for Angelina,"" the source continues. ""He came off as genuinely sorry and Jen was deeply touched. She was completely won over.""

One more in-depth conversation was all it took to cement their friendship. Brad opened up to Jen about the infamous plane incident last year in which he allegedly got physical with Maddox while intoxicated. He also got candid about the custody battle that's still ranging on present-day.

""He soberly spoke about hitting rock bottom,"" the source says, ""and how he made the climb out. He launched into a grand apology. He apologized for being an absentee husband in the marriage — being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for being an avoider, getting lost and in a serious drinking-and-getting-high phase when he fell for Angelina while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith.""

The conversations re-instilled Jen's faith in Brad's sensitivity. In 2005, she infamously remarked that Brad was missing ""a sensitivity chip."" But it seems with these recent, heart-felt dialogues, his chip has been restored in Jen's eyes.

""He told Jen they might still even be married if he were emotionally and physically present and sober at the time,"" the source says. ""It was the most intimate conversation Brad had ever had with Jen.""

The rekindled friendship could even spark some future collaboration. ""Brad wants her involved again,"" says the source, ""and Jen wants in on such prestige projects.""

""Jen has a way of calming and encouraging Brad, which he needs in his hectic life right now,"" the source continues. ""He's in a great place mentally and physically. He's in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before. He is closer to the kids than he has been in months, and he's shown tremendous maturity and patience with Angelina concerning the divorce.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\144fake.txt

I was opening up my almost brand new Dell 600m laptop, to replace a broken PCMCIA slot riser on the motherboard. As soon as I got the keyboard off, I noticed a small cable running from the keyboard connection underneath a piece of metal protecting the motherboard.
I figured “No Big Deal”, and continued with the dissasembly. But when I got the metal panels off, I saw a small white heatshink-wrapped package. Being ever-curious, I sliced the heatshrink open. I found a little circuit board inside. Being an EE by trade, this piqued my curiosity considerably. On one side of the board, one Atmel AT45D041A four megabit Flash memory chip. On the other side, one Microchip Technology PIC16F876 Programmable Interrupt Controller, along with a little Fairchild Semiconductor CD4066BCM quad bilateral switch.

Looking further, I saw that the other end of the cable was connected to the integrated ethernet board.

What could this mean? I called Dell tech support about it, and they said, and I quote, “The intregrated service tag identifier is there for assisting customers in the event of lost or misplaced personal information.” He then hung up.

"Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake on the brink of divorce

The American magazine OK! announced the five-year-marriage has come to an end

Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have decided to go separate ways.

According to the American paper, this could be one of the most expensive divorces from the industry, considering the pair possesses a $300 million fortune.

Apparently, their marriage started to crumble because the conflicts related to their child, careers and Justin’s “other woman” multiplied.

Last month, Jessica attended the Emmy’s Awards Gala alone, looking sad and weak.

According to sources inside their entourage, the situation is the same for months now.

The Emmy Gala was a pretty big deal for Jessica and they usually support each other when it comes to such things.

The fact that Justin refused to be with her proves their relation has deteriorated.

It seems that Justin was on the night of the gala in Brazil, where he performed in a concert, but Biel was obviously bothered by his reaction because he didn’t make any effort.

“Jess feels many times as if she is a single mother and became tired of this. She does not trust him anymore”, revealed a source for OK!, stating that Biel and Justin are also fighting because he is cheating on her.

American singer and actor Justin Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel on October 19, 2012 in southern Italy, after a five-year relationship that began in 2007.

Unless you've been living on a tropical island without Wi-Fi, you probably know (at least) a little about the drama that's been following Taylor Swift around for the past year or so. There's a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, Reputation, addresses her side of the story.

From her tumultuous relationship with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don't have to surf for long to get caught up. But her latest single, ""Call It What You Want,"" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album — and a new beauty look to match.

From what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. Whether she's admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there's certainly something different here.

The private videos-turned-music video — at least that's what it looks like to us — appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new Taylor. (She did say the ""old Taylor"" was dead, if you recall.) Naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. That is: No red lipstick in sight, no ""Shake It Off"" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. According to Twitter, this might be the real image Swift is ready to bring back.

Whether you think this is Swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it's a clever move for redemption, it's hard to deny the pattern we've seen in Hollywood before. Most recently, Miley Cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. Alongside her new album Younger Now, Cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her ""Malibu"" music video where her naked face took center stage.

Only time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\130fake.txt

"Kendall Jenner: Why She’s Quitting ‘KUWTK’ But Remains Proud Of Kylie’s Spin-off Show

Kendall Jenner continues to distance herself from the reality show platform that made her family a household name, with sources stressing that the model wants to have a legitimate career.

Kendall Jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years, and as her brand continues to skyrocket, so are her annual earnings through endorsements, sponsorship deals, and modeling contracts.

Seeing how well things have been going with her career, Kendall Jenner sees no reason why she should remain on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. She’s grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that she’s working harder than ever before, she doesn’t even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore.

From Kendall Jenner’s point of view, the 21-year-old wants to build a brand that’s mainly focused on her modeling career. Sources say that by being on reality TV, Kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry.

She’s worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than Kim Kardashian’s little sister, and while it’s paid off for her, for the most part, Kendall Jenner can’t stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world.

Sharing everything about her life, including who she’s dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. To eventually become as famous and successful as Naomi Campbell or Kate Moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her.

“Kendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylie’s new show, but only when she’s in town and around — she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,” an insider tells Hollywood Life.

For now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on KUWTK, along with her sister’s forthcoming reality show, Life of Kylie. But her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that it’s no longer where her mind is at.

“Kendall’s modeling career is going really amazing, and she’s worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like she’s finally getting there and that she’s now being booked because she’s Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence—and it’s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.”

Last month, the E! network confirmed that Kylie Jenner had landed her own spin-off titled Life of Kylie, Variety reports, which is expected to premiere in July.

The series will follow Kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire that’s focused on beauty and cosmetics.

Kylie Cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while Kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, Kendall’s little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with Tyga.

Anything that could potentially make Kendall Jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if there’s any sort of drama or tension on Kylie’s show, Kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesn’t want to be seen in that light.

Do you think it’s a wise move for Kendall Jenner to ditch KUWTK in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\220fake.txt

"NRA President Jim Porter: “It’s Only A Matter Of Time Before We Can Own Colored People Again”
HOUSTON — It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.

“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”

When asked to clarify Porter said,

“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”

Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”

"Has Khloe Kardashian had fillers?

She emphatically denied that she had any work done on her face to her own sisters on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, but now the truth is out.

Khloe Kardashian has admitted that she got facial fillers on the latest episode of her chat show Kocktails With Khloe, but it didn’t work out how she wanted.

The 31-year-old reality star, who has overhauled her image since her split from former NBA star Lamar Odom, revealed that she had a few bits done but didn’t like the results.

“My face was f****d!” she was heard telling her guests on the show.

Talking to plastic surgeon Dr Terry Dubrow, of the TV show Botched on her TV show, Khloe revealed how the look just didn’t work for her and she returned to get the filler “dissolved”.

“It did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there - I went to have it all dissolved like three times,” she said.

Khloe insisted that the first time she had the work done was before Lamar’s ‘accident’ in October last year, when he was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel after a wild weekend.

“I did it and then Lamar's accident happened,” Khloe explained, claiming that the result was affected by the athlete’s collapse.

“I was so stressed out the doctor was like, ‘I think it's just too much was happening to your real emotions’,” she said.

Raging about the look, Khloe continued: “My face was so f***ed I had to go and get this whole thing dissolved.

“It was a bummer and now I'm afraid to do it again. And I'm almost like, I swear things are still in my face.”

Khloe previously denied having any fillers, and was seen in the season finale of the family’s reality show telling her own sisters – Kim and Kourtney – that she had not received any treatment when quizzed about her changing look.

In scenes that aired in January, following Kris’ 60 Great Gatsby-themed birthday bash in November, Kim is heard speaking to Khloe on the phone.

“Khloe, I was gonna call you and talk to you last night about this,' Kim said. “Your whole face has changed. Did you do any filler?”

Khloe Kardashian kept her look pale and interesting as she stepped out in LA.

The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star showcased her enviable curves as she enjoyed an outing with mum Kris Jenner.

Khloe, 31, bared her bra in a see-through white tank top which she teamed with a pair of form-fitting white jeans.

She completed her look with a pair of aviator sunglasses and high-heeled beige suede shoes.

Momager Kris, 60, kept her look simple in a black blazer, jeans and trainers and her toyboy boyfriend Corey Gamble, 35, looked laid-back in a grey tracksuit.

Khloe stepped out after returning from a boozy trip to Napa Valley with her mum and sister Kourtney.

The trio shared hilarious videos of their tipsy exploits on Snapchat as they sampled the alcohol.

From a conversation about ""squirting"", to some sexy dancing from Khloe, and then THAT chant/rap from Kris - we saw quite the show from the family members.

In one video Kris was seen looking ahead as she continuously chanted: ""Oh walkie talkie, Oh wa, oh wa, oh walkie talkie.""

Kourtney shared a snap revealing half drunk glasses of wine with the caption: ""Hungover wine tasting.""

We bet they had sore heads the next day.

At one point, Kris appeared unable to pronounce the word ""Kindle,"" as Khloe corrected her, saying, ""No, a Kendall is your daughter. Kindle.""

Later Khloe couldn't resist poking fun at her sister Kylie, as she used a face distortion app to make her lips huge - joking that it's the ""Kylie Jenner filter"".

"Dream Scenario? Khloe Wants To Adopt Rob's Daughter!

Khloe Kardashian has formed such an intense bond with her niece Dream, she has told her brother Rob she wants to adopt her, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.

“Khloe can’t get enough of that little girl,” an insider told Radar. “She’s so protective of her because of all the dramas surrounding her folks.”

Radar readers are well aware of the drama between Rob, 30, and on-again-off-again lover Blac Chyna, 29.

Rob even discussed the status of the relationship on the most recent episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

“I want to see [Dream] grow up,” he confessed. “I want to see her grow up and spend time with her every day…I want to keep my family together. I have been working at it for a very long time, but I’m just not sure anymore.”

Neither apparently are the rest his family, and that’s why Khloe has decided to step in, especially if there is a nasty custody battle brewing.

“She knows Rob getting full custody is unlikely,” the source said. “But regardless of what’s going on between Rob and Blac Chyna, she wants to help him co-parent his daughter – and get formal paperwork drawn up to make it real.”

Khloe seems readier than ever to settle down and start a family. As Radar reported, she’s shelling out big bucks planning a wedding with NBA hoopster Tristan Thompson, even though he hasn’t yet proposed.

“She’s set aside half a million bucks, which she figures will pay for at least half the ceremony as well as dresses, catering, entertainment and a five-star honeymoon,” said a source.

Khloe also been showering Thompson with all kinds of fancy and expensive gifts, including jewelry and luxury trips, to keep him from splitting, said one insider.

At 32, her biological clock is ticking away, making taking care of Dream her backup plan, the insider said.

“Khloe does want babies of her own one day, but she wants to be a significant part of Dream’s life,” the source claimed. “She’s totally in love with that little girl!”

"Kathy Griffin Wants To Get Roasted On Comedy Central, Thinks It May Save Her Career

Kathy Griffin got into some hot water after she appeared to be holding Donald Trump’s severed head in a controversial photo shoot — but she has a plan to win back her audience! An insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the comedian wants to be roasted on Comedy Central so she can put herself in a better spotlight. Will it work?


Kathy Griffin, 56, has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy, but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far. After posing for photographer Tyler Shields, 35, where she held a bloody Donald Trump head, the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash — she even got fired from CNN’s annual NYE special. So is her reputation officially destroyed? Maybe not.



Kathy wants to be the next celebrity roasted on Comedy Central. “Kathy knows that she has to combat the recent turmoil she is in with comedy and she wants to face things head on and she wants to be the next person to get roasted,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Kathy thinks this could help save her reputation since she is always lightened up when people tease her. “She wants to show she can take a joke and thinks it will humanize her and make her look better to those she has angered,” our source adds. “She would love to be the next person that Comedy Central considers.”

Comedy Central has roasted a good amount of celebrities, including Justin Bieber, 23, Rob Lowe, 53, and James Franco, 39. Odds are likely that if Kathy does become the next person to get roasted, then the Trump pic will be one of the biggest moments that comes up. And, perhaps, some other celebs will mock her in a way that makes her look better than she does now. But it might be hard to find someone willing to participate in the roast since a lot of celebrities have expressed their disappointment in her, including Debra Messing, 48, Jeffrey Wright, 51, Don Cheadle, 52, and of course, the president, himself.


Kathy took to her Instagram page on May 30 to post an apology video for the photo. “I sincerely apologize. I’m just now seeing the reaction of these images. I’m a comic, I crossed the line and I went way too far,” she said. “The image is too disturbing. I understand how it offends people. It wasn’t funny, I get it. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career I will continue. I’ve asked your forgiveness. Taking down the image, gonna ask the photographer to take down the image and I beg for your forgiveness. I went too far, I made a mistake and I was wrong.”

"Hobby Lobby Stones Gay Employee to Death
Managers at a Hobby Lobby store in Arkansas stoned to death an employee today for being gay.

According to a report in the Ozark Post-Gazette, the store’s management decided to execute Jeremy Gleason, 43, in an alley behind the store in accordance with the Biblical verseLeviticus 20:13, which commands believers to kill homosexual men.

The assailants reportedly tied Gleason to a pole and threw large chunks of granite and whole bricks at his body. An autopsy later revealed the adoptive father of 2 young children died of blunt force trauma to the head.

Although Gleason’s family have called for Hobby Lobby’s managers to be charged with murder, police say they do not intend to make any arrests in the case because the store was simply exercising its religious beliefs.

“I don’t really see the problem here,” says Mark Patterson, Wilson County sheriff, “I mean stoning gays to death is in the Bible. And Hobby Lobby is a Christian company.

“What am I supposed to do? Arrest the people who killed him? Last I checked this was America. We don’t put people in jail for exercising their religion.”

Gleason’s unusual execution comes just days after the US Supreme Court ruled that his employer may be exempted from a federal law requiring employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\16.txt

"Tyra Banks Sued for Causing 'Emotional Distress' During ‘America’s Got Talent’ Taping

*A contestant on “America’s Got Talent” says her performance at a recent taping was roasted so viciously by new host Tyra Banks that it has caused emotional distress to her young daughter, who was watching from the wings.

The woman, identified in the filing as Jane Doe, filed a lawsuit against Banks on Tuesday in L.A. Superior Court accusing the former model of battery and assault, and seeking damages for infliction of emotional distress, reports Variety.

Jane Doe says she and her husband were performing an ode to their daughter, identified as Mary, during a taping on March 19. Once they finished, the woman says that she and her husband were “humiliated” by the judges and the audience, who criticized the song.

According to the suit, Banks added to the humiliation by making fun of the song in front of Mary. Jane Doe alleges that Banks pulled her daughter’s hair back, physically manipulated her, and insinuated that the girl was accidentally conceived.

Afterward, “Mary was traumatized and became deeply depressed,” the suit states. “Mary would become extremely nervous and anxious whenever, among other triggering events, she hears any mentions of [the] song and [the] song itself, whenever she ruminates about the events during or related to the performance, and whenever she thinks about the prospective televised airing or use online of Jane Doe and her husband, their performance, as well as the airing and use online of any footages of Mary.”

Reality show contestants typically sign waivers acknowledging that they may be subjected to ridicule and humiliation. However, the suit alleges that Marathon Productions got Mary to sign a contract without her parents’ knowledge or consent, according to Variety.

After the contestant complained, the company communicated that it would not feature Mary in the broadcast. However, the couple asked that the entire performance not be aired. That request was refused.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\225fake.txt

"Italian town puts dozens of homes on market for as little as €1
British house prices may be crashing, but you would still be hard-pressed to find a cheaper property than those on sale in one Sicilian town, where homes are going for as little as €1.

Dozens of properties have been put up for sale in Sambuca, a hilltop town with stunning views across the Mediterranean island, for less than the price of a takeaway coffee.

The deal is a bid to revive an area that has undergone depopulation in recent years, with residents moving to bigger cities.

According to local officials, anyone interested can more or less make a purchase straight away.

“As opposed to other towns that have merely done this for propaganda, this city hall owns all €1 houses on sale,” Giuseppe Cacioppo, Sambuca’s deputy mayor and tourist councillor, told CNN. “We’re not intermediaries who liaise between old and new owners. You want that house, you’ll get it [in] no time.”

There is a catch, though – new owners must commit to refurbishing their property within three years, at a cost starting from €15,000 (£13,200), and will need a €5,000 security deposit. This will be returned once the refurbishment is complete.

But buyers won’t be disappointed, according to Cacioppo.

“Sambuca is known as the ‘city of splendor’,” he added. “This fertile patch of land is dubbed the ‘earthly paradise’. We’re located inside a nature reserve, packed with history. Gorgeous beaches, woods and mountains surround us. It’s silent and peaceful, an idyllic retreat for a detox stay.”

With the population dwindling, Cacioppo said the town needs outsiders to prevent it from going under.

“We can’t afford to lose our lovely Arab heritage. Luckily, foreigners are lending a hand in this rescue crusade,” he said.

The two-storey dwellings are built with reddish-pink stone and feature courtyards, palm gardens and arcaded entrances. It is also possible to see Sicily’s Mount Etna volcano on days when the sky is clear enough.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\23.txt
"Muhammad Ali was deathly afraid of flying. Louisville just named its airport after him.
On an hour-long flight from Louisville to Chicago in the late ’50s, Cassius Clay prayed he wasn’t going to die.

The teenage Clay, then a dominant amateur boxer, said he hadn’t developed his phobia of flying, one also held by his father, until that fateful flight on a twin-engine jet. “Many times I’ve searched my mind to find where the fear originated,” he said in his 1975 autobiography. Clay recalled how the plane on the flight to Chicago experienced so much turbulence during a storm that “some of the seats were torn from their bolts on the floor.”

“I really thought it was our last ride,” remembered Joe Martin, Clay’s coach, according to Jonathan Eig’s “Ali: A Life.” “And I mean Cassius was praying and hollering! Oh, man, he was scared to death.”

That fear stayed with Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, for most of his transcendent career. So what would Ali, who died in 2016 at 74, say to Wednesday’s news that Louisville is naming its airport after a man who famously hated air travel? “I’m not afraid of the fight,” he told reporters before a 1961 bout. “I’m afraid of the flight.”

As the Louisville Courier-Journal reported, Mayor Greg Fischer said in a news conference that Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport would serve as a reminder that while the boxer belonged to the world, the Kentucky city was his home.

“Muhammad became one of the most well-known people to ever walk the earth and has left a legacy of humanitarianism and athleticism that has inspired billions of people,” Fischer said. “It is important that we, as a city, further champion the champ’s legacy. And the airport renaming is a wonderful next step.""

For years as a young fighter, Ali was able to avoid jets and take trains and Martin’s station wagon to his fights, according to David Remnick’s “King of the World.” But that would all change in 1960.

In May of that year, Clay had to get to San Francisco to qualify for the U.S. Olympic boxing team. If the 18-year-old ever wanted to accomplish his goal of being one of the youngest heavyweight champions in the history of boxing, he had to immediately overcome an opponent not named Floyd Patterson or Sonny Liston — one that the man who called himself “the greatest” couldn’t outbox or trash-talk.

“You’re going to have to fly, son, if you want to be a fighter, fly to places all over the world,” said his trainer, Dick Sadler, according to Ali’s autobiography, “The Greatest: My Own Story.” “It’s a strange fear. But to you it’s real. You’ve got to either overcome it or give up boxing.”

Local media called Clay’s decision to fly to San Francisco “a big one,” adding that if he didn’t take to the air for that fight, then “he might have to ride a lot of buses before he gets anywhere in professional boxing.”

Eig wrote that even though Martin persuaded Clay to fly, the flight hit turbulence over Indiana, causing the charismatic fighter to bend over and again pray for his life. “He went to an army supply store and bought a parachute and actually wore it on the plane,” said Martin’s son, Joe Martin Jr.

While Clay’s supernatural confidence in the ring showed during the Olympic qualifiers in San Francisco, it was nowhere to be found when it came to flying back to Louisville. Instead of flying home with Martin, Clay pawned a gold watch, one of his prizes, to get train fare.

But Clay and his team had an even larger problem than San Francisco: The 1960 Olympics were in Rome.

“When the team was ready to go to Rome, I told Martin I wouldn’t fly,” Ali said in his autobiography. “I’d be willing to take a boat, but the thought of flying over the ocean sent chills up and down my spine.”

Seeing that his fighter was serious, Martin, a police officer who had first offered to teach Clay how to box when he was a boy after he reported his bike had been stolen, took him to Central Park in Louisville for hours in hopes of talking him out of throwing away his chance at gold.

""I calmed him down and convinced him if he wanted to be heavyweight champion of the world, then he had to go to Rome and win the Olympics,” Martin told HBO, according to the Guardian.

He did just that, winning the gold medal as a light heavyweight. Clay pointed to another reason for his sudden courage.

“What I was afraid of most was the plane crashing, and nothing would satisfy me until I called the Air Force and asked them to give me a record of plane flights between Rome and America,” he said in his autobiography. “They said they couldn’t even remember the last time one had crashed. That calmed me down enough to take the flight to Rome.”

The fighter’s aviophobia would come up again. At 21, about a year before he became heavyweight champion for the first time, Clay was scheduled to fly back to Louisville from New York after defeating Doug Jones in March 1963. Ali suddenly grew concerned about his afternoon flight at Newark International Airport, according to Eig.

“When was the last crash?” Clay asked loudly, waiting to board the plane. “When was the last crash?” He had to be hushed by one of this traveling partners, worried that they would get tossed off the flight.

Ali’s colorful personality allowed for him to openly joke about his fear of flying in a 1970 interview with historian Jim Jacobs archived by the Boxing Hall of Fame. The interview was conducted in the lead-up to his fight with Jerry Quarry, Ali’s return to the ring after he was barred for more than three years for refusing to serve in the military during the Vietnam War. To Ali, a turbulent plane scared him much more than Quarry or Joe Frazier, the rival he would fight for the first time months later.

“The only thing [that] scares me is when I’m on a jet and the lady says, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve just been informed by the pilot that we are coming into a thunderstorm. We tried to get around it, but we can’t. It might get a little choppy, so please fasten your safety belts, and we will resume serving dinner in five minutes,'” Ali said, shaking his right hand as if it were a rocky airplane. “And when they get scared and tell you to fasten safety belts — and then I’ll see the stewardesses' eyes big and I see the lightning and the dark cloud. And all of a sudden — Bam! Plane started shaking, the wings flopping, and I think about the plane splitting and the long fall, and I say, ‘Why did I have to rush? I could have took a bus. Oh Lord, if you just let me off of here, I’ll take a train the next time.'

“Boom! The plane’s shaking and falling,” he continued. “And I say, ‘If I get off this plane, I’ll whoop any man in the world.' ”

By the ’80s, Ali had finally conquered his fear of flying, writing that the activity had become “automatic.” He’d later talk about how much he enjoyed sitting in the cockpit with the pilots, saying how he wanted to buy his own plane and helicopter. Ali got so comfortable that his safety had almost become secondary.

“Once, when a flight attendant instructed him to buckle up, Ali replied, ‘Superman don’t need no seat belt,’” Eig wrote. “To which the flight attendant answered, ‘Superman don’t need no plane!’ ”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\42.txt
"Kim Kardashian Trying To Steal Kanye West's Money Through Elaborate Prenup Scheme?

Is Kim Kardashian trying to steal Kanye West's money along with his fame? According to a new report from Star, Kim is treating her prenup to Kanye like a business transaction, which is probably a smart decision. Let's be realistic – how long is this marriage going to last? Two years? Five years? She's already gone through this rodeo once, and she knows that eventually, she'll end up getting Kanye's money if she plays her cards right. The only question is – how much?

Kanye is reportedly worth $100 million whereas Kim is only worth $40 million, and so Kim is supposedly trying to, 'take as much of Kanye's fortune as possible'. A source explains, ""Kim and Kris [Jenner] apparently want a $10 million cheating clause in the prenup too, in the event that the marriage ends due to the rapper's wandering eye. Kris wants Kim to get $5 million a year for each year they're married, plus a $20 million bonus if they last five years.""

Kanye's so whipped that he might actually go for this, and you know that five years down the line, Kris is going to make sure Kim will cash in that $20 bonus. Like, her daughter's happiness? Please, she would rather have the $20 million.

And although we've discussed Kim's demands, Kanye's supposed demands are even more ridiculous. Star claims that Kanye will include something called a 'classy clause', which will, ""prevent Kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings."" Well, I wouldn't count on that lasting, especially since there's only so long Kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\086fake.txt

"Miley Cyrus 'In Tears,' May Quit 'The Voice' Amid Epic War With Adam Levine And Blake Shelton?

The Voice TV singing competition show is fond of using fighting metaphors, from battle rounds to knock-outs. But this season, there's speculation that there are just as many battles being fought when the cameras are turned off as when viewers are watching. Is new coach Miley Cyrus secretly involved in a war with seasoned coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton?

Billboard pointed out that when it comes to the impressions of Miley and the other new coach, Alicia Keys, they're hitting the high notes of a position that can challenge even the most accomplished singer.

Coaches are tasked with taking on aspiring crooners, guiding them through the competition and providing them with tips on everything from stage presence to blending with the band. Even though Blake and Adam are experienced at banter, Cyrus and Keys immediately showed they were up to the challenge of teasing the guys while luring the best contestants onto their teams.

But what viewers can't see is the drama unfolding among Shelton, Levine, and Miley, according to OK. The battle has become so intense that Cyrus was hurt to the point of tears, and now she's doing her best to stay on the show and avoid quitting.

Team Miley seems to be rocking it when it comes to attracting the best wanna-be singers on the show, but sources cited by OK revealed that the ""Wrecking Ball"" singer is struggling because of the incessant feuding. However, even though she's battling both Blake and Adam, she is trying to stay strong, added one of the insiders.

Cyrus has ""been in tears"" during the filming of the singing competition TV show, with her tears caused by Adam ""constantly"" picking on her, revealed the source. Levine allegedly didn't stop with annoying Miley himself. Instead, he also persuaded his buddy Blake to ""gang up"" on the younger singer, added the insider.

Moreover, the feud reportedly has been gradually building to a crescendo, with Cyrus and Adam ""at each others' throats"" since the first day of filming, according to the source.

""[Levine] wants nothing to do with [Miley],"" summed up the insider.

Even though Adam has recruited Blake to help him annoy Cyrus, the source shared that it's Levine who is focused on feuding.

As for just how bad it's gotten, Cyrus has threatened that she will quit The Voice as a result of the environment becoming ""so bad,"" added the insider.

Alicia Keys is noticeably absent from the feud allegations, and Miley recently commented on reports that she and Alicia had teamed up so that for the first time, two female coaches could challenge Blake and Adam.

Dishing with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Miley clarified that she had not chosen to unite with Alicia in order to have a ""boys against girls"" competition on The Voice. Instead, she has been siding with Keys because being sandwiched between Adam and Blake was infuriating, reported 98.7 Radio.

Despite reports claiming that Levine is bickering with Cyrus, she told Jimmy that in reality, it's Adam and Shelton who are arguing constantly.

""It never stops,"" she revealed about the bickering between Blake and Adam. ""Even when the cameras are off, that is real.""

Cyrus admitted that when she viewed the show, she assumed that the playful banter was just done for the cameras. But rather than end when filming stops, Levine and Shelton keep right on bickering.

""I always thought it was like a little thing they do on camera, no, it's all day,"" she summed up.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\096fake.txt
"Ramnit Computer Worm Compromises 45K Facebook Logins
A computer worm that has traditionally targeted the financial industry has set its sights on social networking, recently stealing over 45,000 Facebook login credentials, according to security firm Seculert.

In a statement, Facebook said the majority of the login credentials were outdated, but it was still notifying the affected users.

The worm, known as Ramnit, dates back to April 2010, and is described as a multi-component malware family that infects Windows executable and HTML files, stealing sensitive info like stored FTP credentials and browser cookies, Seculert said in a blog post.

A July 2011 report (PDF) from Symantec said Ramnit was responsible for 17.3 percent of all new malicious software infections.

Ramnit started going after financial institutions in August 2011, possibly merging with ZeusS ""to create a 'Hybrid creature' which was empowered by both the scale of the Ramnit infection and the ZeuS financial data-sniffing capabilities,"" Seculert said.

This approach let Ramnit bypass two-factor authentication systems, allowing remote access to financial institutions, including online banking sessions and corporate networks.

""With the use of a Sinkhole, we discovered that approximately 800,000 machines were infected with Ramnit from September to end of December 2011,"" Seculert said.

More recently, however, Ramnit has set its sites on Facebook and its 800 million users. Of the 45,000 compromised login details, approximately 69 percent were from Facebook users in the U.K., followed by 27 percent in France, and 4 percent elsewhere.

""We suspect that the attackers behind Ramnit are using the stolen credentials to log-in to victims' Facebook accounts and to transmit malicious links to their friends, thereby magnifying the malware's spread even further,"" Seculert said. ""In addition, cybercriminals are taking advantage of the fact that users tend to use the same password in various web-based services (Facebook, Gmail, Corporate SSL VPN, Outlook Web Access, etc.) to gain remote access to corporate networks.""

Seculert said it provided Facebook with all the stolen credentials that it discovered on Ramnit servers, which a Facebook spokesman confirmed.

""Our security experts have reviewed the data, and while the majority of the information was out-of-date, we have initiated remedial steps for all affected users to ensure the security of their accounts,"" the Facebook spokesman said. ""Thus far, we have not seen the virus propagating on Facebook itself, but have begun working with our external partners to add protections to our anti-virus systems to help users secure their devices.""

Facebook warned users not to click on strange links, to report suspicious activity on the social network, and become fans of the Facebook Security Page for additional security information.

Michael Sutton, vice president of security research at Zscaler ThreatLabZ, suggested that Ramnit is simply following the money—and popular culture.

""Just as communication overall has shifted from traditional mediums such as email to social networks like Facebook, malware writers likewise are adopting their victim's preferred means of communication,"" Sutton said in a statement. ""Ramnit was not initially designed to harvest Facebook credentials, but the Ramnit maintainers have recognized the value of Facebook accounts for propagation.""

People are now less likely to click a random link via email, but trust is still relatively high on Facebook. ""Receiving communication from a trusted contact on Facebook will have much higher click-through rates,"" Sutton said. ""Victims are simply not aware that the 'trusted' Facebook account from which the communication was received, may itself have already been compromised.""

In general, Facebook is ""doing a decent job of preventing such attacks, but it has so far been playing a losing game when it comes to preventing the social network from being used as a catalyst to promote attacks,"" he concluded.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\3.txt
"Taylor Swift Spending Millions of Dollars on New Boyfriend, Joe Alwyn: False News or True? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Pop superstar Taylor Swift is buying new boyfriend Joe Alwyn by squandering millions of dollars on her lover according to some reports. Taylor has always been the bigger money earner in all of her relationships. Even though past boyfriends such as Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Tom Hiddleston, and Calvin Harris were millionaires, their bank accounts still paled in comparison to Taylor’s whopping $300 million estimated net worth.

But, Taylor Swift is now dating relatively unknown actor, Joe Alwyn, who has yet to see big-screen success, and fans are wondering if it’s true or false news that she is spending millions of dollars supporting the relationship. His first film, “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” garnered him good reviews from critics, but not much of a paycheck. In fact, Joe has admitted to still living at home with his parents in London.

Taylor Swift met Joe Alwyn last fall through mutual friends and decided to move to London in order to be closer to the struggling actor. She rented a beautiful home in North London close to where Joe’s parents lived. Home rentals in London are some of the most expensive in the world, with some claiming a London rental can cost twice as much as renting elsewhere, but Taylor thought Joe was worth it and signed a six month lease so the two could be together.

Now comes word that she is yet again willing to drop a ton of cash for the actor. Taylor is reportedly shopping for a home for the two of them to share in London’s affluent Chelsea neighborhood. Money is no object and she is willing to pay millions to live in the wealthy neighborhood which other famous Brits, including Pippa Middleton call home.

Although she and Joe will be spending the majority of their time at her house in Los Angeles so he can work on future film roles, Joe is very close to his parents and wants a home close to them so he can visit often and Taylor is willing to make that happen.

It’s not only real-estate that the Grammy winner is willing to spend money on when it comes to her new love. Taylor and Joe have been traveling using her private jets , and just this weekend, the two were seen boarding her private plane in London. The pair first flew to LA to let Joe get settled in Taylor’s home and then the couple headed to Nashville so her new beau could meet her parents.

While it’s true that Taylor Swift apparently doesn’t mind spending millions of dollars on Joe Alwyn, some of the singer’s own fans are starting to feel embarrassed that the pop star is the one footing all the bills and are wondering if a relationship will work out between the two in the long run. Others are just are hoping that with this move to Los Angeles, other movie offers will come in and his career will finally start to take off.

"Brothers gored in Pamplona have no regrets
Two American brothers ran with the bulls in Pamplona, have the wounds to prove it, and are cherishing the experience as a celebration of life and a brotherly bond strengthened by a bout with cancer last year.

“You can either sit on the couch and watch life go by, or you can go out and try to do these things around the world. If that means getting a horn in the leg, I guess that’s the chance I took.” Michael Lenahan told TODAY during an exclusive interview Monday from the hospital room he and Lawrence Lenahan shared since being gored on Thursday.

Fifteen months ago, Michael, a General Mills sales executive from Philadelphia, was diagnosed with testicular cancer. In June 2006, the 23-year-old finished chemotherapy treatments. “So June of this year was one year of being done with cancer,” he told host Meredith Vieira.

His brother, 26-year-old Air Force Capt. Lawrence Lenahan, dreamed about running with the bulls during Pamplona’s annual San Fermin Festival since he was 12 years old. So they decided this was the year to do it.

Dressed in the traditional white shirts and pants and red scarves, the brothers joined people who traveled to Pamplona from all over the world for the event. The festival has been celebrated for more than 400 years, but it became internationally famous in 1926 when it was immortalized in Ernest Hemingway’s novel, “The Sun Also Rises.” Today, the nine-day festival of sangria, adrenaline, testosterone and bulls draws thousands of thrill-seekers to the small village of Pamplona, northeast of Madrid near the French border.

The daily bull run is a half-mile dash down narrow cobblestone streets, with thousands of runners trying to avoid being gored or trampled by a pack of 10 or 12 half-ton bulls. The run ends in the town’s bullring, where the bulls ultimately meet their fates in daily bullfights. Normally, it’s all over in about two minutes.

Since 1924, when records were first kept, 13 people have been killed during the run, the last an American who was gored to death in 1995.

The Lenahans thought they’d done everything right. “We scouted the course out the day before to pick an exciting but safe route,” Lawrence told TODAY. “We backed it up with a few Spanish people who had run in the past.”

‘It was total chaos’ The angry, and no doubt frightened, animals gored both brothers.

Lawrence suffered an eight-inch gash in his backside, while Michael took a horn in his right leg, the horn entering on his shin and tearing through skin and tissue up to his knee.

“It was total chaos for a minute or two,” Lawrence continued. “My brother came yelling at me, and I was hollering at him. I saw that his leg was completely open. It was ripped open. You could see everything inside. And so we knew we had a problem ... I was eventually tackled and we were thrown in an ambulance.”

The brothers insisted on sharing a room in the hospital, where they were upbeat as they talked of their experience Monday. The next event on their schedule had been to participate in a run in Philadelphia next month to benefit the Lance Armstrong Foundation’s LIVESTRONG SurvivorCare program.

They no longer expect to run, but they will both walk in the event. “It’s very important to me that I participate,” Michael said.

The brothers are asking that others join them by either walking, running, biking, volunteering or donating to the cause. They have formed a team called Dos Hermanos — Spanish for “two brothers,” a nickname they’ve been given by the Spanish media — and can be reached by email at Doshermanos.livestrong@gmail.com.

Asked by Vieira whether they have any second thoughts about going to Pamplona, Michael said, “I can’t look back now and say I regret doing it, because it’s been an amazing experience. We’ve met great people, and we just have to learn from it.”

“I really, we really learned something from this,” added Lawrence. “It seems odd to talk about, whether it’s by Michael’s bedside during chemotherapy or in the mayhem on the cobblestones of a Pamplona street, we were there for each other. In a way, it’s a bonding experience. That sounds odd, but it was, and that’s what we take from it.” 

They were at a section of the run called “Deadman’s Curve,” where they let the pack of bulls pass them and started running behind them.

“One bull unexpectedly broke from the pack,” said Lawrence. “The next thing we knew, there was a bull charging us from behind, about ten feet [away]. They’re so fast.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\4.txt

"Tragic Gwen Stefani Loses Hearing After Rupturing Eardrum

Pop songbird Gwen Stefani could end up deaf and wreck her fabulous singing career

Docs ordered the Voice coach not to sing or travel by plane after her career-threatening health crisis.

But The Sweet Escape singer insisted on belting out a tune on The Voice just a week later.

"Jennifer Aniston Cheated On Brad Pitt With Matt LeBlanc While Married? - Report

Brad Pitt, 51, may not have been the only one with a wandering eye during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston, 46. An explosive new interview with Matt LeBlanc's dad, Paul LeBlanc, reveals that the actress actually cheated on her then-husband with her Friends co-star long before Brad met Angelina Jolie, 40, on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith!

""He had fun, that's for sure,"" Paul tells Star Magazine of his son's time on Friends. ""He even had a relationship with one of the girls...Jen. They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt."" OH SNAP!

Don't forget, Jen and Matt's characters had a brief fling on the show at the end of Season 9 and beginning of Season 10, so the whole situation is like life imitating art! And considering Friends ended in 2004, and Brad and Angelina didn't get together until shortly after that, then, if what Paul's saying is true, it means Jen actually cheated first.

This shocking claim could totally change the way we think about the Brad/Jen/Angelina love triangle forever, because it would mean that the Cake star is no longer an innocent victim. However, Paul also noted in Star's interview that he had a falling out with Matt three years ago, and aren't on the best of terms. Do you trust his credibility? ""It is absolutely 100 percent false!"" Jen's rep tells HollywoodLife.com. ""Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.""

Either way, everyone in this whole situation has CLEARLY moved on from whatever happened ten years ago. To everyone's surprise, Brad and Angelina's relationship stayed strong - they have six kids together and were married in Aug. 2014. Meanwhile, Jen has been engaged to Justin Theroux since Aug. 2012.

LaMar, a 15-year-old Sobrato High School student, was last seen the morning of Friday, March 16. She had school that day, but never got on the bus.

The girl has been the subject of a major search over the last week, involving the FBI, helicopters, dogs, roadblocks and divers.

Cardoza said Saturday's search was the biggest mounted since LaMar was reported missing.

The day of LaMar's disappearance, her school's automated attendance system notified her mother, Marlene LaMar, that her daughter didn't show up for classes.

The next day, searchers found her cell phone along the side of the road near Palm and Dougherty Avenue, near her home in unincorporated Morgan Hill.

"Iranian state television anchor arrested after flying into the US
A prominent American anchor on Iranian state television’s English-language service has been arrested in the US on undisclosed charges, according to her employers at the state-backed TV channel Press TV.

Marzieh Hashemi, born Melanie Franklin of New Orleans, appears on the English-language news channel backed by the Iranian government which regularly promotes the worldview of the Middle Eastern state to an international audience.

Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, criticised the arrest, which comes at a time of heightened tensions with the US – and as Iran faces increasing criticism over its own arrests of dual nationals.

“The arrest of Marzieh Hashemi by America is an unacceptable political act that tramples on freedom of speech,” Zarif told state run Al-Alam TV.

“The Americans must immediately end this political game,” he said.

Press TV said Hashemi was arrested at St Louis airport on Sunday and transferred by FBI agents to a detention centre in Washington DC, where she was held for two days before managing to contact her family.

Press TV claimed that she has yet to be charged or informed of the reason for her detention, saying that Hashemi was made to remove her hijab and expose her forearms for a photograph. The channel also claimed she has been denied halal food and was instead offered pork products to eat, leaving her malnourished.

The FBI declined to comment and it is not possible to independently verify the claims made by Press TV.

“Her relatives were unable to contact her, and she was allowed to contact her daughter only two days after her arrest,” the channel said in a statement.

“Press TV would like to hereby express its strong protest at the recent apprehension and violent treatment of Ms Marzieh Hashemi, born Melanie Franklin in the United States, who is currently serving as an anchor for the English-language television news network.”

Hashemi converted to Islam and moved to Iran after being inspired by the Iranian revolution. She was reportedly visiting family members back in the US when the arrest was made.

Press TV broke into its planned broadcasting to cover the arrest and has published more than a dozen statements of support on its website, including from Lauren Booth – the sister-in-law of Tony Blair – who describes Hashemi as a “personal friend”.

The channel, whose presenters have included George Galloway and Jeremy Corbyn, lost its licence to broadcast on television in the UK in 2012 after being found guilty of breaches of the Ofcom code. The channel had previously been fined £100,000 for broadcasting an interview conducted under duress with an imprisoned journalist.

Corbyn earned £20,000 ($25,698) for various appearances on Press TV over several years, including a brief stint hosting a phone-in on the channel.

However, the channel continues to be active on social media, earning attention when it covered an attempt to deselect the Labour MP Joan Ryan, who is chair of Labour Friends of Israel.

Last week, Iran confirmed it is holding US navy veteran Michael R White at a prison in the country, making him the first American known to be detained under Donald Trump’s administration.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman, has been held in Tehran since April 2016. She recently started a hunger strike in protest against being denied access to medical care.

An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, told state TV that Hashemi’s arrest indicates the “apartheid and racist policy” of the Trump administration.

“We hope that the innocent person will be released without any condition,” Ghasemi said.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\39.txt

"Did Meek Mill Find Nicki Minaj In A Lesbian Tryst With Young M.A.?

Finding a story about Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill isn't exactly a stretch. Last year, Meek Mill's beef with Canadian rapper Drake kept us entertained for months, and Minaj is hardly low-profile. Over the past few years, Minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. As a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj story. In recent weeks, most stories about Mill and Minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop's power couple are still dating or not.

In recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that Meek Mill walked into Minaj's dressing room to find her and female rapper Young M.A. in a lesbian tryst. Ace Showbiz has speculated that Meek Mill and Minaj split last month after Meek lost his cool. Mill went on an Instagram rant at Minaj and then deleted his account. The same site reports that MediaTakeOut claims Minaj has become infatuated with female rapper Young M.A. and has split with Meek as a result.

All Hip-Hop claims that Minaj ""plays for both teams"" and says that she certainly has ""rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious.""

Of course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest Mill-Minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. Indeed, a glance at Minaj's Instagram account suggests that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed Halloween together. Nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with Mill.

Gossip Cop reports that the stories claiming Mill and Minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers.

""The webloid's perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. Minaj and Mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on Instagram Monday morning. ""And while the relationship might not last forever, Minaj is not ""dropping"" Mill for Young M.A. MediaTakeOut should probably start looking elsewhere than Twitter and Instagram for its made-up stories.""

Of course, some might question why Gossip Cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill. After all, they seem to rely on the images posted on Minaj's Instagram account as evidence that Meek and Minaj are still an item. One has to wonder if Gossip Cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond Instagram for stories.

Many will wonder why Minaj and Mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. The truth may lay in Minaj's hunger for publicity. According to Hip-Hop DX, Minaj was recently quoted as saying that Meek Mill's high-profile beefs with the like of Drake are great publicity. Perhaps Minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity.

The reality is that the public has no right to know anything about Mill and Minaj that the couple doesn't want shared publicly. It is easy to claim that Minaj and Mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. There is no doubt that artists like Minaj and Mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. Some claim this makes them ""fair game"" for the gossip columns.

The reality is that Nicki Minaj's sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or ""slut-shamed"" for it. The inner workings of Minaj's relationship with Meek Mill are no one's business but their own.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\048fake.txt
"MTO EXPLOSIVE TEA: Word Coming Out Of BARBADOS . . . . Is That Rihanna Is PREGNANT . . . Just ONE MONTH After She's Seen FLIRTING With The Prince Of England!!!

December 29, 2016: We just got some EXPLOSIVE TEA from out of Barbados – where Rihanna has been staying for the past week. People close to her are speculating that she may be PREGNANT.
Why are they saying this? Well here's the tea:

The word here is that Robyn [Rihanna] is pregnant. She's been [in Barbados] for the past week and no smoking, or drinking, not even weed.
Rihanna is known for partying hard and has a particular FONDNESS for Broccoli – and we're NOT talking about the vegetable either. It's surprising that she's given it ALL UP at once.

Our snitch continued, even speculating that if Rihanna is pregnant, the most likely father is PRINCE HARRY – who was seen flirting with the Bajan Queen a month ago. MediaTakeOut.com's insider explained, ""When the Prince [Harry] was here, he flirted with Robyn [Rihanna] and they ran off together without security. My guess is that he is the father [if Rihanna is in fact pregnant].""

And our snitch is not the only ones. A quick search of social media pages from Bajans reveals that the ""Rihanna pregnant"" rumor is blowing up in the small Caribbean island.

Beyonce reportedly has become the mother of healthy twins, according to MTO News. The 35 year-old star reportedly gave birth to a boy and a girl on Saturday, May 20. She’s reportedly recovering well and being taken care of at Cedars Sinai in Los Angeles.

Bey and Jay took advantage of their last few months as parents of one with a romantic trip to the Grand Canyon in April.

Beyonce posted a ton of spectacular pictures and even caption an especially sweet one of herself with Jay with a lyric from her own song “Die With You.” ““No I don’t really need these legs if I ain’t walking by your side…..and I don’t really need to be if I can’t be with you,” she wrote.

"Brad Pitt reportedly dating Princess Charlotte of Monaco

Find out the ins and outs of the allege­d 'love story' here

Following a bitter break-up from actress Angelina Jolie, rumours surfaced suggesting Fight Club star Brad Pitt to have moved on. That too, with a princess – Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco to be specific, reported Australian magazine New Idea.

The two allegedly made their public appearance as a couple last week as they attended a Los Angeles Country Museum of Art event together, the magazine further reported.

Angelina Jolie: Brad Pitt is ‘terrified’ that the truth will come out

“No one could believe it when we saw them together,” sources told the magazine. They continued, “There have been rumours circulating for weeks that Brad has moved on with a new woman but no one was ready to see him hand-in-hand with royalty from Monaco.”

31-year old Charlotte and Brad were seemingly introduced to each another by Brad’s Allied co-star and good friend Marion Cotillard as she is very close friends with Charlotte. Marion, who Brad has previously been linked with, was keen for him to find happiness after Brad’s messy split with Angelina.

Brad Pitt finally opens up about his bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie

However, Gossip Cop has called the Australian magazine out on this story and went on to ‘set the record straight’. Gossip Cop is a website that patrols the celebrity gossip industry in search of discrediting untrue rumours.

Not only are the actor and royal not dating, she isn’t even a princess, reported the online platform. Charlotte is the daughter of Princess Caroline of Hanover and is not a princess herself. She is the granddaughter of actress turned Princess Grace Kelly.

After checking in with Brad himself, Gossip Cop went on to state that the actor exclusively assured them that he and Charlotte are not in a relationship. New Idea’s article regarding the non-existent relationship was simply bogus.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\135fake.txt
"Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms

On March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers. 



Once the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS' helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper - and away from the public eye - Melania dropped the act. And Donald's hand. ""Melania,"" a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, ""does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.""

That includes the presi­dent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who's currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC's Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. ""They have separate bedrooms,"" says another Trump insider. ""They never spend the night together - ever."" (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: ""It's very 'royal' of them!"") 



Upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, ""Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,"" explains the family source. ""She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him."" A rep for Melania denies the claims telling Us, ""It's unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed 'sources' that have provided fictional accounts.""



Since assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn't set foot in the nation's capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly. 



Melania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister's wife, around Palm Beach in February, but ""only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,"" according to the family source. ""She refused to do it in Washington.""

Dane County Circuit Judge Valerie Bailey-Rihn said the effort to force the hand recount, which was backed by Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign, did not meet the state's legal standard for prohibiting the use of machines in the recount, saying that the two campaigns did not show a hand recount, though more thorough, was necessary or show there was a clear and convincing evidence of fraud or other problems.

Rumors have previously circulated that the TV star may have gotten Botox, a nose job, and maybe even breast implants. However, Megyn, 46, has never addressed the talk that she's gotten procedures done throughout her career.

"Mom Calls 911 On Masturbating Teenage Son; Boy Arrested, Charged With New ‘Self-Rape’ Alabama State Law
An Alabama teenager is being charged and held without bail, facing 3-15 years in prison over a new ‘Self-Rape’ state law implemented by AL Gov. Robert J. Bentley last month.

Montgomery, AL — An Alabama boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Montgomery Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends Jefferson Davis High School. The teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Alabama state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.

This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Alabama Governor Robert J. Bentley. Bently spoke with local news station WSFA 12 News about the charges against the boy.

“I applaud the Alabama District court systems here in Montgomery,” Bentley said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. I plan to do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”

Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the Alabama Southern District Court, broke down in tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.

Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:

“911, what’s your emergency?”
“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in this house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to violate his body in such a matter. I’m so shaken up! Please send help immediately!”

33-year-old Martha Horner, mother to the young boy, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.

“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”

Ms. Horner’s controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.

“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Martha Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”

A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.

“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great a great man as Governor Bentley, we’re ridding the demons from these heathen’s pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”

Officer Tom Downey with the Montgomery Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Montgomery Fox News station WVOC about the arrest.

“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his ‘girl on girl action’, as he said it, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There is no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that I tell ya. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”

Detectives confiscated pornography and lube found in the teenager’s room as evidence.

Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Alabama state law of Self-Rape A.R.S. §§ 34-171 & 52-69 would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.

Horner is currently being held at the Montgomery County Jail. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is May 3rd.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

"It's Official: The Spice Girls Reunion Is Actually Happening

About a year ago, the Spice Girls were celebrating the 20th anniversary of their single ""Wannabe."" The single, which, despite being the group's first, managed to hit the top of the charts in almost every country it was released, set the precedent for the quintet to be one of the biggest musical forces of their time — a destiny that was fulfilled tenfold.

To celebrate the monumental anniversary, three of the group's members—Mel B (Scary Spice), Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice)—all climbed into bed together to record a special thank you video for the fans. Casually mentioning a ""special party"" that the fans ""are all invited"" to, the members also slyly hinted at an upcoming reunion.

Later, the members announced that they would be touring the following year, with a special concert slotted for London's historic Hyde Park. Though Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) have both assured the public that they had no plans to join the other three in the reunion, it seemed like the trio (which rebranded as GEM) was still determined to power forward.

Unfortunately, a pregnancy for Geri put the reunion plans on an indefinite hiatus — but even after the singer gave birth to her child in January, there was still no word on when the group would get the ball rolling again. Now, according to a report in Page Six, we have official confirmation that the reunion is back in the works thanks to Mel B's impending divorce from her soon-to-be ex-husband Stephen Belafonte. According to the report, Belafonte's ""controlling influence"" had always been an ""unnerving presence"" for the group. But now that he is out of the picture and Scary Spice is finally free, Ginger Spice confirms, ""We're not re-forming immediately, but in the near future.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\139fake.txt
"Liza Minelli Has 'Three Months Left' To Live After Tragic Relapse: Friends Tell All

Liza Minnelli's sad life has taken one tragic turn after another - and it's finally gotten the best of the beleaguered star!

The Academy Award–winning actress and singer has waged a desperate battle against drugs and booze her entire life, as well as a slew of devastating health problems. Now, RadarOnline.com has learned that her friends fear for her life.

Minnelli, who just turned 70, has suffered a shocking relapse and is back to her old habits, claimed a spy.

In September, she sold her luxe New York apartment, where she had resided for more than a decade. Minnelli is currently living in a rented Los Angeles home and is controlled by her assistants, claimed the insider.

PHOTOS: Hollywood's Addiction: 24 Stars Who Died From An Overdose

The latest drama comes after she recorded a bizarre message in which she seemed to be bidding farewell to close pals and adoring fans.

""I wouldn't be who I am without you, any of you, and on top of that, I just remember all of the goodness and all of the kind wishes and the support and the friendship,"" she said in the message, released shortly after her March 12 birthday.

Strangely, she concluded with, ""Thank you very, very much. I'll never ever forget you.""

""It was chilling listening to it,"" one longtime Hollywood insider told Radar after hearing the message. ""Liza sounded like she was saying farewell. It was just heartbreaking. People have to be worried. You just have to wonder if she has three months left.""

PHOTOS: What Happened Here? Celebrity Deaths That Remain A Mystery

As Radar previously reported last April, a killer combo of alcohol and prescription pills landed the Cabaret star in a Malibu rehab center. She has ""spiraled out of control"" after a painful new back injury, which she sought help for in her fifth rehab stint, dished a source.

While Minnelli's rep denies she's dying, her health woes have been numerous. She had two hip replacements, contracted double pneumonia in 2000, battled viral encephalitis a few months later, broke a kneecap in 2003, fractured her wrist in three places in a 2013 tumble and underwent back surgery the following year.

""Liza has been through so much,"" lamented the spy. ""You just have to wonder how much more she can take. People are worried about her. Right now, all we can do is pray.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\063fake.txt

"A Thing For Blondes? Brad Pitt Is Ready To Move On With Margot Robbie

Is Brad Pitt back to blondes? Shortly after his split with Angelina Jolie, rumors swirled about Pitt’s on-set chemistry with Allied actress Marion Cotillard. Linked to many of his co-stars throughout his long career, including his soon-to-be ex, it’s no wonder Jolie wasn’t keen to have him work with blonde bombshell, Margot Robbie. A source exclusive to OK! reports, “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now.” According to the source, the 41 year old actor and President of Plan B Films has “tried to woo her for numerous movie projects. This was a sore subject with Angie who blocked them from working together a few times. Now he’s single again you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.” And who could blame him? The 26 year old Australian beauty has been dubbed “the new Angelina Jolie,” stirring fear in the hearts of celebrity wives. She has her own reputation for on-set chemistry with married actors including Will Smith.

"Wells Fargo Attempts To Gain Control Of Your Money -- Wells Fargo has begun to put into play it's plot to control consumer spending. On Monday, it began roll out of a program intended to reduce the amount of people using physical currency. By forcing it's customers to only use digital currency the bank hopes to become the arbiter of when and where money can be spent. Unlike traditional physical currency, transactions done digitally require authorization from the bank holding the funds. Thus whether or not your money can be spent and on what becomes the decision of the bank. But it isn't only Wells Fargo moving in this direction. The U.S. Government has long been pushing banks to move in this direction. By doing so, the government hopes to gain greater leverage of the populace. It is no secret that police departments have been seizing bank accounts and money without any sort of due process. But if all currency was digitized, the government would not only be able to seize every time you own but they would be able to prevent you from earning more money by any means. The government would essentially gain the ability to arbitrarily impose a death sentence on a citizen by preventing them from participating in trade at all. Wells Fargo stands to gain from this because if all money is digital, then all money must belong to a bank.

"Sarah Jessica Parker Inherits Vogue Magazine Control From Anna Wintour? | Celeb Dirty Laundry

There's only one Anna Wintour, but there's only so long that she can run Vogue. Anna's now 64 years old, and while she's still got plenty of years to keep running Vogue, her reign isn't going to last forever. Eventually, she will have to find a successor, and according to a report from Radar Online, that successor will be Sarah Jessica Parker.

Now, before you laugh yourself to sleep, listen to Radar's reasoning. Sarah and Anna are friends, and have been friends for a very long time, thanks to the long running popularity of Sex and the City. Vogue owes a huge debt to the show for putting it on the map, especially since the magazine didn't use to be the household name it is now.

Anyway, Radar's source explains, ""Anna is worrying colleagues who believe she has found her true successor in Sarah! It's a surprising idea, but one that is not entirely a joke. Anna thinks Sarah, a fashion icon on Sex and the City, truly has what it takes to step into her shoes and take on a role at Vogue one day. Although Wintour has made no announcements about when she might retire, her scheme to put Parker in the Vogue pipeline has co-workers shaking in their own designer shoes.""

You know, the idea's not as far-fetched as it sounds. Sarah's very fashion savvy, and while she doesn't seem like she'd be able to run Vogue as well as Anna [who would?], she does have the contacts and image to keep the brand name strong.

What do you guys think? Is Anna Wintour grooming Sarah Jessica Parker to take over Vogue for her? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\065fake.txt
"Kanye West Is Reportedly in Talks to Judge an 'American Idol' Reboot

In today's installment of ""Why Is This Happening?"" a reboot for American Idol is reportedly already on the table-and Kanye West is a sought-after potential judge.

Although the famed singing competition ran for an impressive 15 seasons and ended less than a year ago (the series finale aired on April 7, 2016), RadarOnline.com reports that NBC is pursuing the Chicago rapper to join the judging panel for a revival of the show, thanks to former host and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer, Ryan Seacrest.

""Ryan Seacrest has put his name forward during his negotiations to come back as host and NBC are salivating over it,"" an anonymous source told the site. Apparently, West is at ""the very top of the wish list"" above Simon Cowell, and he's already started ""grilling"" Jennifer Lopez, who became an Idol judge in 2010, about the position.

""It's not an easy gig, but the offer he's got is proving to be very hard to refuse,"" the source added.

"Tom Hiddleston Still Embarrassed About Taylor Swift: Ignores Fans and Media at Comic-Con | Celeb Dirty Laundry

For the past several years, actor Tom Hiddleston has been a fan favorite at the San Diego Comic-Con. But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, “Thor: Ragnarok” were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston’s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, “Thor” has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.

Although Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.

This is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting “Thor: The Dark World”, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.

Audience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn’t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom’s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn’t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.

Many believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom’s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.

Of course, Tom and Taylor Swift’s romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reported that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\188fake.txt
"Beyonce's Officially Gone Overboard With Her CRAZY Delivery Plan Demands & Here's Why

There’s no denying that Beyonce is one of Hollywood’s biggest diva’s but new sources suggest her demands just got even crazier. In anticipation of the arrival of their beloved twins, the singer and her husband Jay-Z have concocted a delivery plan so insane you’d think they’re royalty. On the heels of reports that the famous couple have moved to a rental property close to Los Angeles’ Cedars-Sinai hospital, where Bey’s due to give birth, insiders tell Heat magazine that “the event is set to be a no-expense-spared extravaganza.” Click through to get the scoop inside Beyonce’s delivery room plans, and how the couple’s daughter, Blue Ivy, will have a very peculiar role in the process.

“Bey and Jay want three suites in the hospital- they only had one for Blue. This will give their people space and allow for security, who are needed because people will inevitably try to sneak in and take pictures of the twins,” a source tells the tabloid. Understandably, the duo are “not taking any chances.” BT45tW4A8mR

And what’s more is that the famous parents have asked their five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, to help deliver the twins. “Beyonce has decided Blue will be part of the delivery process to make sure she’s not jealous of her new siblings. Blue has her own birth plan written up, and will be staying in the room throughout. She’s set to be the first person to hold the babies after the doctor handing them to Jay-Z.” BTrg0rEg9gY

The insider continues, “Blue’s got $1,200 Givenchy nurse’s outfit, and a notepad to write down the twins’ weights. She will also help to tie the identification bracelets on their wrists.” Sources tell the outlet that Blue “isn’t nervous about seeing her mum give birth – quite the opposite. She’s really excited.” BTN6tgmAC-W

Once the twins are born, they’ll undoubetedly be some of the most richest babies in the world, and the couple will do whatever it takes to protect them. “The twins’ protection is paramount, and word is they’ve hired ten security guards for each one. They won’t all work at once, but there will always be at least two each around the clock. The cost is a couple of million dollars a year, easily.” BSXePJMga6x

Downing Street has again insisted the prime minister is determined to stick to her Brexit “principles”, including rejecting a customs union and a second referendum, as she embarks on cross-party talks to try to salvage her Brexit deal.

With the clock running down to Brexit day on 29 March, May was holding a series of talks on Thursday, which kicked off with the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas.

May’s official spokesman insisted these conversations would be approached “in a constructive spirit, and wanting to hear what the various groups have to say”.

But when asked whether May was willing to flex any of her negotiating red lines, he said they remained in place.

“Where people have pre-existing positions, of course they will want to make their argument for them, and the PM is going to listen, but you understand the principles which the PM holds, which she believes honour the result of the referendum,” he said.

“The PM has set out over the course of many months now what she believes the British people voted for, and what she believes is necessary to honour the referendum. She stands by those principles.”

On the specific issue of a customs union, which is a key demand of both Labour and backers of a Norway-style softer Brexit, he said: “The PM is absolutely clear on the importance of having an independent trade policy in order to honour the result of the referendum.”

Members of the customs union cannot strike their own trade deals. May’s spokesman said: “The ability for the UK to reach out throughout the world and strike its own trade deals is an important element of taking back control.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\22.txt

"Justin Bieber apparently wrote a ‘Love Bible’ about Selena Gomez, and it’s sweet but super weird

There have been numerous reports of Justin Bieber spending time in church in the past few months, but what we didn't realize was it wasn't any old church he was visiting — it was the church of past relationships.

Bieber's fans are currently convinced the 23-year-old pop-star has been abiding by a ""Love Bible"" he wrote while rekindling his romance with ex, Selena Gomez, and reports even claim the ""Sorry"" singer has “10 Commandments” for their “revived relationship.”

The relationship “just might last” this time around because he “made himself a list of 10 commandments"" for wooing his on-and-off girlfriend, an “insider” is quoted as saying, adding that Bieber has been following the commandments “religiously.""

He's also reportedly sworn off partying and is meditating daily to stay focused.

“Some of the commandments are all about romance,"" the insider says, explaining that others are just about being ""open and trustworthy"" and a few are about being more present for Gomez.

While no full list has been revealed, the source claimed ""Thou shalt cook food for your girlfriend” is one of them, which anyone can get on board with.

Besides, Bieber was spotted giving his Pastor an 18 second hug last week, and that's all the evidence I need to know he's changing his ways and is ready to accept Christ back into his life.

This boy has always loved a good bible.

For now the rest of us will just have to stick to the 10 commandments of being a Belieber, because thou shalt NEVER say NEVER.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\106fake.txt
"This Quirky Car Is Japanese. But There’s ‘Something Very British’ About It.
By Richard Pérez-Peña
LONDON — It just might be the most adorable thing on four wheels. People smile when one cruises by. They point, they wave, they use the word “cute” a lot, and they ask, “What is that?”

The tiny Nissan Figaro has an almost cartoonish design that is guaranteed to stand out. To an American living in Britain, who regularly spots pristine Figaros, it would appear to be a highly popular model that was made recently.

Every part of that guess is wrong: The Figaro is rather old, built for the 1991 model year, and there never were large numbers anywhere. Nissan never even exported it from Japan.

Yet here it is in Britain, in the thousands, an oddball little convertible with an ardent following and a back story that is even odder.
More on that in a minute.

Britain never had dominant carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. Instead, for generations, it had a profusion of small-to-medium manufacturers.

Those carmakers produced a much wider array of designs than their American counterparts, a good number of them quirky, small, underpowered, none too practical — and beloved by their many admirers.

But in the face of foreign competition, recessions, bankruptcies and consolidation, British car manufacturing plummeted from its peak in the early 1970s. Brands like Morris, Triumph, Austin, Sunbeam, Daimler, Rover and Reliant died off.

An increasingly competitive and global market had less room for eccentric cars, British or not, or for models that sell only a few thousand.
“Cars have lost their personality,” said Nic Caraccio, a devoted Figaro owner and trader who lives outside London. “If you go out on the street now, the Citroëns and Vauxhalls and Skodas and Peugeots, they’re all black or white or silver, and they all look the same. Not the Fig.”

Definitely not. And it is the look that entices people here — the curvy, throwback shape, and the front end that could have been the face of one of the animated characters in the movie “Cars.”

“The quirkiness, there’s something very British about it, isn’t there?” said Colin Bullock, a harbormaster in London. “It’s so familiar to people, even if they’ve never seen it before. They say, ‘Oh, I used to have one of those in 1962,’ which is impossible, and I just smile.”

Owners join Figaro clubs and Facebook groups, give their cars names, often buy more than one per family, and sometimes pay over 10,000 pounds, or $12,500 — more than the car cost new.
They drive in Figaro rallies and attend classic car shows, proudly displaying their budget compacts the way other people show off their pricey Aston Martins and Rolls-Royces.

People who took their Figaros to a show in Guildford, a town southwest of London, said one of its best features was the built-in social circle. That comes in handy when the owner’s manual is written only in Japanese.

“The one thing that worried me when I met my husband, Ian, was whether he would love the car,” said Zoe Collier, who lives in Surrey, runs training courses and calls her car Figlet. He did.

The Figaro may look a bit like a sporty roadster, but performance is hardly the point. It has a small engine, just under one liter, and the only transmission available was a pedestrian three-speed automatic.
It has an unusual “fixed profile” convertible roof — the middle folds down, but the sides stay put. The legroom in what passes for a back seat would cramp all but the smallest passengers.

“It really harks back to the more interesting cars in the past, when there was more of a homegrown industry,” said Steve Huntingford, the editor of the British car buying magazine What Car? “A lot of people really loved those cars.”

Vehicle production in Britain gradually recovered from its 1980s nadir, but what has emerged is an industry that is not very British. There are six large-scale carmakers in the country — and every one is foreign-owned.

Niche luxury brands of British heritage like Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Lotus are also now foreign-owned, as is the maker of London’s famed black cabs. The few British makes that are manufactured in Britain by British companies, like Aston Martin and Morgan, account for less than 1 percent of the country’s car production.
For many years, it has hardly mattered to the British market where cars were made; most vehicles made here are exported, most sold here are imported, and membership in the European Union allows for seamless trade with 27 other countries.

It could begin to matter a great deal if Britain leaves the union, as it is scheduled to do on March 29. Manufacturers worry that new trade barriers will obstruct both their international supply chains for parts, and the movement of finished products.

Analysts say that is unlikely to create a renaissance in British manufacturing for British consumption, much less a return of the idiosyncratic products of old. People looking for something really out of the ordinary will have to keep turning to rarities like the Figaro.

Nissan built the Figaro in pale shades of aqua, green, gray and taupe — one of a few idiosyncratic, limited-edition models the company made in that era.
The company originally planned to build just 8,000 Figaros, priced at about $8,300, and strictly for the Japanese market.

Even before sales began, it was clear that demand would far exceed that figure, so Nissan held a lottery to choose its buyers. Celebrities were among those in the running, generating still more interest.

Nissan expanded production to 20,000, but even so, most would-be buyers were turned away. Despite the unmet demand, the company stuck to its plan to make the car for just one year.

From early on, a very few appeared in Britain, as people visiting Japan — including Eric Clapton — bought Figaros and had them shipped home.

The car required only minor modification to be street legal in Britain, and drivers here, as in Japan, sit on the right side of the car.

Until 2016, the Figaro was barred from the United States because it did not meet emissions and safety standards, but cars become exempt from those rules 25 years after they are made.

It took several years before a semiregular pipeline to Britain was created by people like Mr. Caraccio, who buy, repair and resell cars, and who began going to Japan to find Figaros and send them back a few at a time. The first big Figaro gathering here was held in 2008.

More than 3,000 of the cars are registered as being in active use in Britain, but numbers are no longer rising, and the pipeline has slowed to a trickle.

“There’s only so many, and they’ve been around awhile,” said Peter Pattemore, who drives a Figaro (named Jimmy), as does his wife, Sandra (hers is Sally). “But we’re going to keep them as long we can.”",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\31.txt

"Brad Pitt Texts Jennifer Aniston Nonstop: Seeks Intense Emotional Support After Angelina Jolie Divorce! | Celeb Dirty Laundry

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly gotten back in touch through texting, even though sources from both sides are falling over themselves to clarify that it's 'just texting' and not anything more serious.

Oh, Jen. She's probably so happy inside, even though she would never admit it for fear of coming across as petty. Think about it – this is the same man who humiliated her by dumping her for another woman, and now he's the single one while she's happily (or seemingly happily) married. AND he's texting her! It's all her dreams coming true.

Anyway, sources claim that Jennifer and Brad have been casually texting over the past few days, and Brad has been discussing how difficult the divorce has been for him. Apparently, Jennifer has been helping him through this, which is a little suspicious. Being magnanimous, fine, but offering support and advice to an ex-husband that you spent more than a decade getting over? Um... no.

It's been several months since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce and took their kids with her, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Brad Pitt has been having a tough time since then. He's withdrawn from the spotlight, and we probably wouldn't have seen or heard from him at all if it were not for the fact that he produced Moonlight, one of the most visible films on this year's awards circuit and the eventual winner of this year's Best Picture Oscar.

Regardless, for whatever reasons, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are back in touch – and how does Angelina Jolie feel about this? Well, apparently, not very happy. Again, not much of a surprise. Angelina may have been the one to call it quits, but that doesn't mean that she's over her ex-husband, the same way he's not over her.

She didn't leave because she fell out of love with him, she left because of his 'issues', whatever those issues were. And now, to hear that he's talking with his ex-wife, the woman that he left for her? Let's just say – if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie weren't already broken up, that might have done the trick.

My problem is not with the people coming to Jena to march, they have that right, but with the American Red Cross giving away supplies to the marchers. The newspapers have stated that approximately 25,000 bottles of water were given out. I will not mention any medical care that was provided, but we do have a local hospital that offers excellent
medical care, but not for free.

I sat on the balcony of my office and watched the marchers arriving carrying no supplies, but when they left Jena they were carrying bottles of water that was supplied by your organization. These people were not in a disaster mode, they knew what they were getting into when they came to rally, and should have planned better and brought their own supplies.

I had a house burn in 1985 and lost everything, including my cars and dog, but never got a call or note from the Red Cross. I did not mind that I was not contacted by you and have not ever given it a second thought until yesterday. I have donated faithfully to the Red Cross for the better part of my 56 years, but no more.

"Robert Pattinson Recovering From Alleged Drinking Problem - Realized Substance Abuse Would Tank Career! | Celeb Dirty Laundry

According to recent reports and hints dropped by Hollywood sources, Robert Pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. It would certainly explain why he's been hanging out with Zac Efron, of all people. We already know Zac isn't known for his sobriety, and Rob has been partying quite a lot lately.

Star Magazine's source claims, ""Rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup with Kristen [Stewart], and he turned to alcohol to numb it all. He drank a lot every night, and even during filming. But his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles.""

Is this so hard to believe? Daniel Radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. Clearly, something about all these YA franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with Rob's situation, he's always been a social drinker – maybe a little too much.

He's admitted to drinking before auditions, and he's usually photographed at bars or parties these days. Even if his vice isn't alcohol, plenty of people have said that Rob's had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven't technically been proven yet.

And trust me, they won't be. Rob's people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won't go to the press with this. And if Star's source is right, then he's already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. Alcohol doesn't do the best things to people's faces or bodies, and it's not like Rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks.

"EXCLUSIVE PICS: First photos of Ariana Grande since Manchester attack

An emotional Ariana Grande was spotted for the first time since the terror attack at her Manchester concert on Monday as she touched down in her hometown of Boca Raton, Florida.

The pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on Tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend Mac Miller, who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the 23-year-old singer.

Ariana, who was dressed in head-to-toe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie, shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with Miller before being whisked away in an SUV caravan to a family member's home in a nearby gated community.

Miller could also been seen warmly embracing Ariana's mother Joan, who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black, and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles.

Police cars were also seen surrounding Joan's nearby home, less than 24 hours after 22 people lost their lives and another 119 were injured when a improvised device went off inside Manchester Arena just moments after Ariana performed her final song.

Joan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on Monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos.

Rather than panic however, she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage, where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem.

Ariana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack, but did post a message on Twitter early Tuesday, writing: 'broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.'

The pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her much-anticipated European tour, which kicked off in Stockholm on May 8 and was set to wrap up on June 15 in Rome.

She and Joan made a quick and quiet departure from England early Tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star Taylor Swift, who lent the two women one of her private jets. Sources told TMZ, however, that Swift wasn't involved in the process, as the private jet was financed down the middle by Grande's touring corporation Live Nation and manager Scooter Braun.

ISIS is now taking credit for the Monday night massacre, with authorities identifying 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage.

The blast from Abedi's improvised devise went off just seconds after Ariana finished her final song of the evening, with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts.

Abedi is the British-born son of Libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where Ariana performed on Monday.

Police are still investigating whether or not Abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack, and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack.

That individual, who is 23, has not yet been identified by police.

Investigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on Monday by Ariana's young fans and the arena's surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out.

Prime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical, meaning an attack could happen imminently in Britain.

If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005.

Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.

One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said 'Thank you, Manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion.

The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.

Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.

City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident  while Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.

The names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing Ariana perform live for the first time.

Eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. Even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother Lisa still has no idea as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life.

Saffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack.

Georgina Callander, 18, lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at Ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert.

Two years prior, Georgina had got to go backstage and meet Grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star.

Saffie and Georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of Tarleton, and on Tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short.

Some carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'I LOVE MCR.'

With the whole of Britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming June 6 election our of respect for the victims.

A number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of Monday night's attack.

David Beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for Manchester United, posted on Facebook: 'Heartbreaking news from Manchester. As a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. My thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...'

His Spice Girl-turned designer wife Victoria, who lived in Manchester after marrying Beckham, added: 'My heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in Manchester last night.'

Swift, who later offered up her private jet to Ariana, wrote: 'My thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the Manchester tragedy tonight. I'm sending all my love.'

Katy Perry also commented on the violent attack, saying: 'Praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... Broken hearted for the families tonight. Broken hearted for Ari. Broken hearted for the state of this world.'

And Rihanna wrote: 'Manchester has always been so close to my heart! These are innocent vulnerable kids, this could've been any of us! I'm devastated!

'Praying for the beautiful souls we lost, their families and loved ones, for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this #Manchester.'

One of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from British-born talk show host James Corden, who was taping his late night program in Los Angeles when the attack occurred on Monday.

'It shocks me every time we hear this sort of news, that attacks like this can happen, but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight.

'Many of you won't have ever been to Manchester, but you will definitely have heard of it. It's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, Man City, Man United. It's famous for incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division.

'It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. It's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character.

'But when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find.

'Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.

'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff of the MEN arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, Ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. We'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.'",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\206fake.txt

"Gisele Bündchen hits back at minister's 'bad Brazilian' jibe
The Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen has rebutted an extraordinary attack by Brazil’s agriculture minister, who called her a “bad Brazilian” for her environmental activism and said she did not know “the facts”.

Bündchen said the “bad Brazilians” were those responsible for Brazil’s worst deforestation figures in a decade.

In a letter addressed to the minister, Tereza Cristina Dias, published in Brazilian media, Bündchen lamented government figures showing deforestation had increased by more than 13% in a year.

“An immeasurable heritage threatened by illegal deforestation and the squatting of public lands. These, yes, are the ‘bad Brazilians’,” she wrote.

In a tweet, she said: “Since 2006 I have been supporting projects and getting involved in socio-environmental causes”. In the letter she said that her grandparents were farmers, so she understood the importance of agriculture to Brazil.

The war of words has highlighted rising international concern over the future of the Brazilian Amazon under the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonaro has attacked the “fines industry” of environmental protection agencies. His foreign minister, Ernesto Araújo, regards global warming as a Marxist plot. And the environment minister, Ricardo Salles, this week suspended contracts with non-government bodies for 90 days and promised surprise visits to check what they were doing with government money.

In 2017, Bündchen criticised Brazil’s then president, Michel Temer, over plans to remove protected status for a large area of the Amazon – a move Temer later revoked. Last November she tweeted her opposition to Bolsonaro’s plans to fuse the environment and agriculture ministries – an idea that, along with withdrawing Brazil from the Paris climate deal, he later gave up on.

Dias made her comments in a radio interview on Monday. Bündchen countered Dias’s accusation that she did not know “the facts”, pointing out in the letter that she had been to the Amazon, was a United Nations environment goodwill ambassador and had taken part in the launch of the Global Environment Pact at the UN general assembly in 2017 at the invitation of the French president, Emmanuel Macron.

She said she had “participated in countless meetings with corporate presidents, universities, scientists, researchers, farmers and environmental organisations, where I was able to exchange information and learn more and more about how to take care of our planet”.

"Ellen DeGeneres Dines With Mystery Brunette Amid Divorce Rumors With Portia de Rossi

Ellen DeGeneres stepped out with a mystery brunette recently amid rumors of her impending divorce with wife Portia de Rossi. Photos of the TV host all smiles with the unknown woman only fuelled speculations of their separation.

According to reports, DeGeneres stepped out with the mystery brunette on June 1. She enjoyed a vegan meal with the mystery woman at Crossroads in West Hollywood. The host seemed to be in a jolly mood as she and her date left the restaurant.

Photos emerged of the pair leaving the restaurant and walking the street. DeGeneres did not seem perturbed by the attention and at one point even waved at the camera. She also continued to smile for the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the mystery brunette appeared bothered by all the attention and continued to keep her head down. DeGeneres' wife de Rossi was nowhere to be found.

DeGeneres' date supposedly came after she and de Rossi were spotted bickering at each other at a restaurant. The host's cheerful demeanor with her mystery date supposedly also differs from the previous weeks, when she appeared tense with de Rossi.

Photos of DeGeneres with the mystery brunette only seem to fuel rumors about her divorce with de Rossi. However, the host has since denied these claims. She told People in a previous interview that her marriage with de Rossi remains intact. ""I can't imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world,"" DeGeneres said.

Likewise, she shut down rumors about her divorce with de Rossi in an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM. ""We really don't almost break up, we don't fight, we're madly in love, and I guess it's boring,"" DeGeneres said as quoted by Entertainment Tonight.

DeGeneres also admitted that she does not read the tabloid. She does not pay attention to the divorce rumors surrounding her marriage to de Rossi. This probably explains why she appears cheerful and at ease during her date with the mystery brunette.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\242fake.txt
"Kanye West -- 'Nervous Breakdown' ... Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom's Funeral

Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom's Funeral

Kanye West just snapped a week ago Monday in what we're told was a ""nervous breakdown"" ... triggered in large part by the anniversary of his mother's death.

Sources very close to Kanye tell TMZ ... he was increasingly becoming a powder keg of emotions in the weeks leading up to his hospitalization at the UCLA Medical Center ... fueled by what we're told was a shocking lack of sleep and the pressures of touring, running his businesses, parenting and providing emotional support to his wife who was suffering her own emotional trauma after the Paris robbery.

But our sources say the trigger for the breakdown was Donda's death back in November 2007. Her funeral was November 20 -- the same day he cancelled his show at the L.A. Forum. The following day -- November 21 -- Kanye cancelled the remainder of the tour and hours later suffered the breakdown.

People close to Kanye tell us he never effectively grieved over his mom's death and has always had a difficult time in November, but this time he reached the breaking point.

Kanye, we're told, has had trouble handling stress over the last few months, and in the week or so before the breakdown he started to unravel.

As we reported ... Kanye became paranoid when he was taken to UCLA ... refusing for a time to even let doctors touch him. He also ranted that people were trying to ruin his marriage.

Kanye was sedated and is being treated by doctors and mental health professionals. Doctors hoped to release him 2 days ago, but that didn't happen and so far ... no new release date.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\014fake.txt

"New Research Suggest That Men Who Cheat On Their Spouse Are More Honest And Emotional
This, of course, begs the question: Why? Why do men really cheat? And why do they sometimes continue cheating after they’re caught, even in the face of profoundly unwanted consequences like divorce, loss of parental contact, loss of social standing, and the like?
The truth is that all sorts of dynamics can play into a man’s decision to engage in infidelity. Generally, though, his choice to cheat is driven by one or more of the following factors:
Love: Most men cheat because they just love so much they can’t control themselves and sometimes this leads to cheating but he cheats because he a lover.
Honesty: Sometime a man is so honest with another woman it might lead to a sexual encounter with another female.
Emotional: Men try not to show their emotions but like anyone sometimes they need a shoulder to cry on and this may lead to accidental cheating
Accidental: Most men don’t cheat purposely sometimes is accidental forgiving your man for accidentally cheating can help you build a better relationship with your partner.

"Josh Duhamel was over Fergie ‘being a rock star again’

Josh Duhamel was tired of his pop-star wife Fergie’s “partying” before their breakup, we’re told.

Sources close to the actor tell us that he didn’t want to split with his wife of eight years.

According to pals, their marriage broke down over the course of about a year, in spite of trying couples’ therapy.

The long slide coincided with the recording of Fergie’s first solo album in 11 years, “Double Dutchess.”

“[Fergie] was very focused on her album and being a rock star again, and Josh felt like she was going back to her ‘old ways,’ ” we’re told.

The former Black Eyed Peas singer was a notorious party animal in her youth, and even battled drug problems — although there has been no suggestion she has started using drugs again.

Reps didn’t get back to us.

Page Six reported this week that fans are wondering if Fergie’s upcoming second solo album was inspired by her breakup with Duhamel, with tracks such as “Love Is Blind” and “Love Is Pain.”

Fergie admitted to Page Six, “There’s a lot of my life, and my vulnerable side.”

"Caitlyn Jenner's Memoir Reportedly Lands Movie Adaptation, Rob Lowe May Play Her

Report says that the 'How to Be a Latin Lover' actor is currently in talks to play the reality show star in a possible movie based on her new memoir 'The Secrets of My Life'.
Caitlyn Jenner new memoir ""The Secrets of My Life"" reportedly will be adapted into a movie, with ""How to Be a Latin Lover"" actor Rob Lowe reportedly in talks to play her. A source told OK! that the actor would be interested to portray the Olympian-turned-transgender reality show star. 

""Rob’s been hunting for an awards-caliber movie part. This would be a game-changer for him,"" a source told the magazine. The insider went on saying that Caitlyn had sent Rob a copy of her book and that ""they've met up a few times to discuss it."" The source added, ""She thinks he's got what it takes to play both her and her former self, Bruce, and now Rob's throwing his weight behind the project as well."" 

However, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply ""not true."" A rep for Rob tells the site that ""he hasn't met with the reality star to discuss a potential biopic."" Caitlyn simply said in an interview that Rob indeed would be a good choice to portray her in a potential film, but the idea hasn't been brought into real life yet. As for the memoir itself, there hasn't been any official announcement whether or not it will be adapted into a movie.

"Orthodox Child with Rare Ailment is Rescued Aboard Tycoon’s Jet
The private Boeing 727 of real estate tycoon Donald Trump arrived from Los Angeles at LaGuardia Airport Tuesday morning, carrying aboard an Orthodox Jewish child with a rare and still undiagnosed breathing illness.

The child, Andrew Ten, age 3, arrived with his parents — accompanied by three nurses who attend to him around the clock — to try to seek medical help in the New York area.

Trump made his plane available for the special trip to New York after the boy’s parents, Judy and Harold Ten, called Trump and told him of their plight.

Commercial airlines refused to fly the child because he could not travel without an elaborate life-support system, which includes a portable oxygen tank, a suction machine, a breathing bag and an adrenaline syringe.

“Mr. Trump did not hesitate when we called him up. He said ‘yes, I’ll send my plane out,'” 29-year-old Harold Ten recalled shortly after he landed here Tuesday morning.

Asked why he thought Trump made his private jet available, Ten replied, “Because he is a good man. He has three children of his own and he knows what being a parent is all about.”

Ten said he believes that Trump fulfilled the Talmudic saying that “he who saves one person’s life is as if he saved the entire world.”

Among the relatives at the airport to greet the child and his parents were the paternal grandparents of the sick boy.

“Donald Trump is a miracle, just a miracle,” said grandmother Feigy Ten, who came to the airport with her husband, Phillip Ten.

Both grandparents thanked Trump’s generosity over and over again.

Andrew, who is called by his Hebrew name, Avraham Moshe, was taken from the airport to the Schneider Children’s Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center for treatment and evaluation.

Andrew was healthy at birth, but one morning when he was 10 months old he suddenly stopped breathing. The second incident occurred six months later. Doctors had no explanation and to date have not determined what is causing him to stop breathing.

Andrew has not cried in the last two-and-a-half years. He now eats with a feeding tube since he lost his gag reflex and the ability to swallow. He is monitored around the clock by nurses, and sleeps with an apnea alarm.

Harold Ten said he and his family “are determined to do anything possible to save Andrew. We believe in God and we have hope,” he said.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\32.txt
"Kentucky newspaper removes criticism of Trump from woman's obituary
A newspaper in Kentucky has apologised after refusing to print a line in an obituary of an 87-year-old woman that suggested frustration with Donald Trump had hastened her death.

The sentence omitted from the obituary of Frances Irene Finley Williams read: “Her passing was hastened by her continued frustration with the Trump administration.” Laurie Bolle, the director of sales for Gannett, the company that owns the Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, said the decision to cut the line was “a mistake”.

“Mrs Williams’s obituary should have published as it was presented to our obits team and as requested by the family,” said Richard A Green, the Courier-Journal’s editor.

He added: “In this political climate we now find ourselves, partisanship should have no role in deciding what gets included in an obituary that captures a loved one’s life — especially one as amazing as what Mrs Williams led. I’m certain she is missed greatly by those who loved her. We send the family our deepest condolences and apologies.”

Williams died just before Thanksgiving last year. Her daughter, Cathy Duff, said her brother had told her on Christmas Eve that the Cremation Society of Kentucky, which had been dealing with the obituary, had received an email from Gannett saying: “Per our policy, we are not able to publish the obituary as is due to the negative content within the obituary text.”

The email, seen by the Washington Post, added: “You are more than welcome to remove the negative content so we may move forward with publishing if you wish.”

The family agreed to remove the line referring to Trump but Williams’s son, Art Williams, wrote a Facebook post on 5 January that said: “I was, and still am, dumbfounded, surprised, but most of all disappointed and aghast that a once historically courageous American newspaper that exists by reason of freedom of speech would so trivially move to abate the free speech that it seems, when convenient, to hypocritically champion.”

The post prompted a backlash against the paper.

Duff said politics had been a “vital part” of her mother’s personality, which was why she had wanted to include the line in the obituary, which cost $1,684 to publish.

Her mother’s interest in politics stemmed from growing up in the Great Depression, experiencing poverty that she felt could have been prevented, she said.

Duff said Green called the family to apologise on Tuesday and informed them that the obituary would run in full.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\29.txt

"Tory ministers have saved an iconic gay bar once visited by Princess Diana

One of Britain's most famous gay bars which Princess Diana reportedly visited with Freddie Mercury was today given listed building status.

The iconic Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which featured in last year's hit film Pride about the 1984-5 Miners' Strike and where Lily Savage once started a riot, was given Grade II protection.

The 153-year-old pub - one of Britain's most famous gay bars and close to spy agency MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross - has been at the centre of a planning row after being sold to property developers last year.

But the listing will make it much more difficult to close the bar and build flats - and is a victory for the RVT Future campaign.

Founder Amy Lamé said: ""The listing is a fantastic milestone for our community and a victory against the odds for our beloved pub.

""We look forward to continuing our work to ensure the RVT remains a vibrant space of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community and culture for generations to come.""

The pub has a rich and colourful history.

Princess Diana was allegedly disguised as a male model and smuggled into the venue in the late 1980s.

Queen singer Freddie and comedians Cleo Rocos and Kenny Everett dressed Diana in an army jacket, cap and sunglasses for a night out at the south London pub.

Lily Savage once started a riot at the RVT when it was raided by cops in 1984.

And it featured in the smash hit movie Pride, which told the story of how a group of striking Welsh miners received the unusual backing of a group of lesbian and gay activists from London's emerging gay scene, with the pub acting as a backdrop.

The RVT's supporters include TV host Graham Norton and Lord of the Rings star Sir Ian McKellen.

Historic England's Director of Listing Roger Bowdler said: ""The Royal Vauxhall Tavern is an enduring and important venue for the LGB&T community.

""Built on the site of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, it carries on the tradition of alternative and bohemian entertainment which is bound up in this part of London's history and identity.""

Heritage Minister Tracey Crouch said: ""I am thrilled to be able to list the Royal Vauxhall Tavern as Grade II - the iconic cultural hub in the heart of London is of huge significance to the LGB&T community.

""Not only of architectural interest, the venue has a longstanding historic role as a symbol of tolerance and alternative entertainment.""

""Residing in Lambeth since 1860, the landmark venue has been the springboard for so many of our loved UK entertainers.

""I am delighted that the listing will preserve the history of this venue for future generations to enjoy. I hope that it continues to be filled with laughter and joy.""",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\059fake.txt

"A 2-Year-Old Boy Is Trapped in a Well. Spain Is Watching.
By Raphael Minder
MADRID — The well is over 300 feet deep, but less than a foot wide. And somewhere in its depths a 2-year-old boy is believed to be trapped.

Frantic efforts to rescue the toddler, Julen Roselló, have been underway in the countryside northeast of the port city of Málaga after he was said to have slipped down the well while his parents were preparing Sunday lunch.

About 100 rescuers have been working at the site, covered round-the-clock by the Spanish news media, while Julen’s father has made repeated pleas on television for every effort to be made to find his son alive.

On Wednesday, the authorities in southern Spain announced that according to a preliminary DNA test, hair found in mud excavated from the well was the boy’s, confirming his presence. He is believed to be more than 250 feet underground, beneath earth dislodged by his fall.

The rescue operation includes specialists dispatched from Asturias, the coal mining region of northern Spain, as well as a Swedish company that provided the technology to help save 33 Chilean miners trapped for two months underground in 2010.

To reach Julen, rescuers are drilling two separate tunnels, one of which runs closely parallel to the well while the other is designed to open an alternative horizontal access route, using as a starting point a platform excavated into the hillside near the well.

They are also using special machinery to remove earth that is blocking access to the deepest section of the well, and installing a tube inside the shaft to reduce the risk of more earth falling into the well.

José Roselló, Julen’s father, told reporters that “we have an angel that will help my son come out alive as soon as possible.” Julen’s parents already lost their first son, who died when he was 3 from a congenital heart defect.

María Gámez, a local official in Málaga, told reporters on Wednesday that preliminary DNA testing was conducted on hair found within some of the muddy earth extracted from the well, which amounted to the first “scientific evidence” confirming that Julen was down below.

Jesús Esteban Gutiérrez, a colonel from Spain’s military police, told local news media that a dozen teams were involved in the rescue operation, but the police had also received over 60 additional offers of help from companies worldwide. “We’ve lost count,” he said.

The media spotlight on the rescue operation in southern Spain is reminiscent of that triggered by past efforts, like the one last year that saved 12 boys and their soccer coach who were trapped for more than two weeks in a flooded cave system in Thailand.

Another hopeful parallel may be the case of Jessica McClure, who fell down an abandoned well in Texas as an 18-month-old in 1987, and remained trapped for 58 hours until rescuers completed a parallel shaft and pulled her out. She was caked with dirt, but healthy.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\27.txt
"In age of Trump, Obama is the new tabloid darling


Donald Trump might be the original tabloid president, but while he works long hours in Washington making phone calls from the Oval Office and wreaking havoc on Twitter, the gossip pages and fashion blogs are spilling a lot of ink chronicling his predecessor.

Buoyed by their celebrity, the Obamas still attract attention when they're spotted on the street. But freed from the constraints of the office, their fans are now running into them on vacation, at lunch or outside SoulCycle.

"Taylor Swift 'files documents to launch streaming service'

Taylor Swift has reportedly filed documents to launch her own streaming service in the wake of her backlash against Apple Music and Spotify.

The Shake It Off hitmaker, who hit out at streaming services for offering her music for free in 2015, is said to have made moves to brand a website 'featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings'.

TMZ report that the website will be dubbed 'Swifties' and will launch a line of music products complete with guitars, picks, straps and drumsticks atop organising educational trips, online courses and retreats.

Taylor's now-famous feud with streaming services saw her reveal she will not allow her latest album on Apple Music to protest its 'shocking' lack of artist compensation during a free trial period.

The move by Taylor, who is one of the most outspoken critics of Spotify, delivered an early blow to Apple's bid to dominate the booming sector two years ago.

She said that the tech giant, which launched Apple Music in June 2015, will not pay for songs streamed during a free three-month trial period for new subscribers.

'I find it to be shocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company,' she wrote in a posting on Tumblr.

Taylor - whose '1989' was the top-selling US album in 2014 and remained high on the charts - insisted that she was speaking for all artists and not just herself.

'This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt.

'This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field...but will not get paid for a quarter of a year's worth of plays on his or her songs.

'These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much.'

'Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done,' she continued.

'I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.

'But I say to Apple with all due respect, it's not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.'

"Is the Queen preparing abdicate?

His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI announced it through the Vatican, to shock and surprise.

A poised Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to YouTube, and King Juan Carlos of Spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill.

Queen Elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do.

Abdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of Royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle Edward VIII quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.

And there is no indication that that will ever change.

Yet with the Queen now into her 92nd year, and with the hard-working Duke of Edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96, plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see Charles appointed King in all but name.

Palace sources have indicated that the Queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation called the Regency Act to come into force – granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives.

I have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. They have all confirmed that a Regency with Charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility.

One senior former member of the Royal Household said: ‘Out of the profound respect the Queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, Her Majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. She is dutiful to her core.

‘Her Majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the Crown is seamless.

‘I understand the Queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at 95, she will seriously consider passing the reign to Charles.’

Clarence House – the household of Prince Charles – is making no comment about Plan Regency, as it has been called. However, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court.

But Palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be ‘up to speed’ on the 1937 Regency Act, which grants power to the heir apparent ‘in the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the Royal functions in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign in certain other events’.

The development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court – a series of senior staff changes and departures at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, home to the young Royals.

The Queen’s Private Secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, 55, resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a ‘wholesale regime change’ – as revealed in The Mail on Sunday.

His shrewd deputy – former banker, political adviser and television executive Edward Young, 50 – will replace Sir Christopher after a suitable handover period.

I understand that a number of other high-profile figures – many loyal to Sir Christopher – are poised to leave the Royal Households at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace after his unexpected exit.

They include Assistant Private Secretary Samantha Cohen, the capable former Press Secretary and Sir Christopher’s number three in the private office. Ms Cohen, who is Australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the Queen.

Falklands and Afghanistan veteran, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Master of the Queen’s Household, is also said to be weighing up his position. Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when Prince Philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, Sir Michael Stevens.

At Kensington Palace, the Duchess of Cambridge has hired a new Private Secretary, Catherine Quinn, who is head of the University of Oxford’s Said Business School. It is understood she will take up her new role in October.

Prince William’s Private Secretary, former Ministry of Defence communications expert Miguel Head, and Prince Harry’s Private Secretary, former Blues and Royals Captain Ed Lane Fox, 40, are also said to be considering their options.

Perhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at Clarence House, home to Prince Charles.

Of course, the transition to a world in which significantly more Royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. Next month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working Royals, and Prince Harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmother’s side.

‘As ever, the Queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,’ said the former member of the Royal Household. ‘Of course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.’

That is not in doubt. On her 21st birthday in 1947 the then Princess Elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. Speaking from Cape Town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous.

‘I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening,’ she said. ‘I should like to make that dedication now. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.’

It was a conviction that she confirmed in her Coronation Oath on June 2, 1953.

While it may be acceptable for Queen Beatrix and King Juan Carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, Palace aides still believe the ‘A word’ is not part of Her Majesty’s vocabulary.

There is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the Queen, at 91, is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands – one who is now without the company of Prince Philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year.

The monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve.

Charles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her Diamond Jubilee year to Australia and New Zealand.

Earlier this year he went in her place to Canada to mark the nation’s 150th anniversary. On a tour of the Persian Gulf, he represented the Crown and was treated like a king with other Royals bowing to him.

More will no doubt come as the Queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties.

A Regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover – and, indeed, the Act was considered in more recent times when the Queen first acceded to the throne.

Documents show that following the Coronation of 1953, the young Elizabeth II intervened to ensure that Prince Philip – and not her sister Princess Margaret – would take over as Regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before Charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. This was not, of course, required.

Times have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today?

Certainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly.

To safeguard against a coup, a Regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the Sovereign’s consort, in this case the Duke of Edinburgh; the Lord Chancellor, David Lidington; the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow; the Lord Chief Justice, the incoming Sir Ian Burnett; and Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton.

Clarence House and Buckingham Palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. But as one insider told me: ‘We are in uncharted territory right now – a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.’",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\161fake.txt
"Military to Pledge Oath To Obama, Not Constitution
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is extremely frustrated with orders that the White House is contemplating. According to sources at the Pentagon, including all branches of the armed forces, the Obama Administration may break with a centuries-old tradition.

A spokesman for General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, states that the Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution.

""The oath to the Constitution is as old as the document itself."" the spokesman said, ""At no time in American history, not even in the Civil War, did the oath change or the subject of the oath differ. It has always been to the Constitution.""

The back-and-forth between the White House and the Defense Department was expected as President George W. Bush left office. President Obama has already signed orders to close Guantanamo and to pull combat troops from Iraq. But, this, say many at the Defense Department, goes too far.

""Technically, we can't talk about it before it becomes official policy."" the spokesman continued. ""However, the Defense Department, including the Secretary, will not take this laying down. Expect a fight from the bureaucracy and the brass.""

Sources at the White House had a different point of view. In a circular distributed by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, the rationale for the change was made more clear.

""The President feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.""

""We expect a lot of flak over this,"" the classified memo continues. ""But those that would be most against it are those looking either for attention or control.""

The time frame for the changes are unknown. However, it is more likely that the changes will be made around the July 4th holiday, in order to dampen any potential backlash. The difference in the oath will actually only be slight. The main differences will be the new phrasing. It is expected that the oath to the Constitution will be entirely phased out within two years.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\fake\32.txt

“She’s refusing to eat!” one concerned insider told The National ENQUIRER. “Angie weighs just 82 pounds and looks absolutely anorexic. If something isn’t done soon, she’ll waste away to nothing!

“There’s no meat on her bones, her eyes are sunken into their sockets and her arms and legs are achingly skinny!”

Angie’s skeletal frame at the L.A. premiere of “Kung Fu Panda 3” on Jan. 16 shocked fans everywhere.

Now it’s time for her loved ones, including husband Brad Pitt, to act!

“They need to make Angie understand the dire straits she’s in,” the insider said. “Her health situation is going from serious to dire!”

Added Franci Cohen, a New York City nutritionist: “If she keeps pushing boundaries, her body will shut completely down without further warning.”

After viewing pics of Angie at the event, Dr. Art Mollen of the Mollen Clinic in Scottsdale, Ariz., said he’d “immediately” admit a person in her condition to an inpatient behavioral treatment center.

“This requires a multi-disciplined approach including psychiatrists, cardiologists, nutritionists and even the family to save the person’s life,” Dr. Mollen noted.

“Anyone who has a significantly low body weight like this and consistently abuses their body in this way can cause his or herself major harm,” he explained.

Her prognosis “would have to be guarded at best. Any time I see a person suffering with what appears to be anorexia, there are deep-seated problems, whether it’s in the marriage or elsewhere.”

Angie, 40, has continually ignored her health as she focuses on her career and humanitarian work, as The ENQUIRER has reported.

But Angie refuses to “slow down her hectic lifestyle” — although docs have told her she could be a prime candidate to develop cancer if she doesn’t look after her health — and even warned her, “You will die!” — a source said.

The mom of six underwent a preventive double mastectomy in 2013. She’s since also had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.

Those surgeries forced her body into early menopause — putting her at a greater risk of a wide array of life-threatening ailments, including cardiovascular and neurological diseases.

“Sometimes she goes a full day without eating a solid meal, and other days sleeps until late afternoon because she’s so worn out,” said one worried pal.

Another source said: “She looks incredibly gaunt, her skin is practically translucent. Her hair has thinned out. She looks terribly ill.”

Medical expert Dr. Stuart Fischer said he believes Angie is suffering from cachexia, a wasting syndrome that can dramatically increase the chance of death from an underlying condition.

Brad, 52, is alarmed by his wife’s appearance, sources said, and has consulted with therapists, dietitians and other experts to help Angie. But she refuses to slow down or take care of herself — even though she’s so underweight she suffers dizzy spells!

“He’s at the end of his rope,” a source said.

It’s time for Angie’s nearest and dearest to stage an intervention, and convince her to get help — before it’s too late — insiders said.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\122fake.txt
"German Power Spat With Denmark Holds Up Single Market Trade

A long-running squabble between Denmark and Germany over power cables linking the countries has cut the amount of electricity Nordic producers can supply to Europe's biggest market to the lowest level in 17 years.  Germany cut import capacity from mainland Denmark by 89 percent on average last year  the most since a power market between the nations started in 2000. It's a consequence of Chancellor Angela Merkel's unprecedented Energiewende: the shift to wind and solar power mean surges in renewable energy production make it hard for the nation's grids to handle its own electricity  let alone imports.  The dispute is undermining the European Union's goal of breaking down national barriers for power to boost energy security and cut costs through more cross-border trading. Talks between Germany and Denmark have floundered  with no resolution emerging from their latest meeting on the matter in Berlin last week.",real,data/raw\overall\overall\real\biz25.legit.txt
"Are Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal Dating Again?

There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.

The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.

The source said, ""Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn't ready for a serious relationship, but now she's showing Jake how much she's matured. She's excited to see where things go.""

In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.

An unidentified source told Star magazine that, ""He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor's new number. They've kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""

This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.

""This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex's and starts talking about how he's heard we're going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together - just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, 'This is what we're writing,'"" she once revealed to GMA.

The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""

In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.

Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

Do you think Taylor should get back together with Jake? Tell us in the comments.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\021fake.txt

"'It was a long time coming': Heidi Klum ends seven-year marriage over Seal's 'volcanic temper'

Seal and Heidi Klum insisted their split was 'amicable' yesterday despite reports that the supermodel could no longer put up with the Kiss from a Rose singer's volcanic temper.

In a formal statement, the superstar couple finally confirmed rumours swirling around for days that they were breaking up.

According to the US celebrity website TMZ, Klum, 38, demanded a divorce because she was worried about the effect Seal's was having on their children. 



The claim followed reports that she was also fed up with the 48-year-old British singer's 'hard partying.'

There was no suggestion of infidelity, but one source said: 'It was a long time in coming.' 



Heidi father Gunther Klum - who had the German model with wife Ema - today spoke out about the breakdown of the couple's  marriage.

He told US Weekly magazine: 'We are very sad.'

A statement released by the couple today read: 'While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.

'We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.

'This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.

'We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.'



at Seal's beachfront home in Mexico in 2005 , Seal and Klum kept their promise to renew their vows every year on their  anniversary with their close friends and family.

They have three children together – Henry, six, Johan, five, and Lou, two – as well as Miss Klum's daughter Leni, seven, from a previous relationship with Italian businessman Flavio Briatore.

And the tension in their relationship is believed to have started when the pair holidayed with their three children in Ibiza in August.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'They were always the couple everybody strived to be but lately it all started to change. Seal seems to have been partying a lot more often than usual.

'When they had their holiday in Ibiza last summer, Seal hit it hard, was out at clubs and with his friends a lot and Heidi was left with their kids trying to enjoy herself. The cracks were appearing and everybody was talking during that trip. He seemed off the rails.'

The insider added: 'They've spent a lot of time apart too on work assignments and that hasn't helped matters.

'Then when Seal came back to the UK to do promotional work for his next album, he seemed sleepy and not with it on shows like Loose Women, when he was very late for his appearance.'

And a source told The Sun today: 'The marriage ended months ago in reality. They rarely saw each other and it wouldn't be unusual for them to go months without spending any real quality time together. Ships that pass in the night would be an overstatement.'

German-born Heidi, 38, is reportedly expected to file papers at Los Angeles' County Superior Court this week citing 'irreconcilable differences'.

Happy: The couple were last seen together on December 26, with Heidi tweeting this picture of them on holiday in Aspen, Colorado

Happier times: Klum and the Crazy crooner share custody of their four children - Leni, 10, Henry, 8, Johan, 7, and Lou, 4 (not pictured)

Seal, 48 – real name Seal Henry Samuel – left a cryptic message posted on his Twitter page on Friday that read: 'The End.' 



The message was attached to a picture that appeared to show the star's forearm bearing an imprint of a set of wings – a possible reference to Miss Klum's role as a Victoria's Secret winged 'Angel' model.

The split paves the way for a multi-million-pound divorce battle between the golden couple. 



Heidi, one of the world's most in-demand models, is reported to have earned more than £12 million in the past year alone.

Seal, who is best known for his Kiss From A Rose single, has sold more than 20 million albums and won three Brit Awards and three Grammys in a career spanning 20 years. 



The couple own a home in Mexico and an £8.4 million mansion in Los Angeles. Yesterday there was no sign of them at the LA house, which is set in an exclusive gated community in Mandeville Canyon, in the Hollywood Hills.

On Wednesday, Seal was in London to pre-record a performance of his new single Backstabbers for Jonathan Ross's ITV chat show, which was broadcast on Saturday night.

Staying professional: Seal was in London last week to pre-record his performance on Jonathan Ross' show, which was broadcast on Saturday night Day job: Heidi has been known in recent years for presenting fashion-based reality show Project Runway Meanwhile, Miss Klum was alone as she attended the Golden Globes awards in Hollywood last Sunday.

 News of the split comes just weeks after the couple posed, apparently happily, for a photo on a skiing holiday in Colorado. On December 26 Miss Klum posted a picture on Twitter of the couple on the slopes in Aspen with the caption, 'Sun and Snow and  @Seal'. Miss Klum divorced her first husband, stylist Ric Pipino after five years together in 2002 and met Seal a year later in 2003.

"Axed! Jennifer Hudson Won’t Be Asked Back To 'The Voice' Over Nightmare Diva Behavior

Jennifer Hudson’s first season as a coach on the NBC’s The Voice will likely be her last, as RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned that her “diva antics” were just way too much handle for the cast and crew!

After winning the U.K. version of the hit reality singing competition show, Hudson, 36, joined Miley Cyrus, 24, Adam Levine, 38, and Blake Shelton, 41, for season 13 of the U.S. version.

According to a well-connected production source, Hudson and Shelton’s bickering was a huge problem for producers!

“Blake cannot stand Jennifer at all. The two are constantly at war both on-camera and off-camera and it has gotten to the point where he cannot even talk to her or look at her,” the source said.

But it isn’t only Shelton’s feathers that Hudson has ruffled! “She is also hated among the crew too,” the insider dished to Radar.

“Jennifer does not show up on time and is a complete diva when she does. She is constantly complaining about her outfits and is always unhappy with her hair and make-up,” spills the behind-the-scenes snitch.

“But honestly there is only so much that they can do!”

Lately, Hudson has been constantly plugging her own production company, JHud Productions, from her judging chair.

“She is using this platform for her own gain and she got reprimanded by execs for it,” the source said, adding, “And she still continues to do it anyways.”

As Radar previously reported, both Hudson and Cyrus are being ousted next season and are being replaced by returning coach Alicia Keys, 36, and Kelly Clarkson, 35.

"Adventure & Romance! Inside 95-Year-Old Betty White's Bucket List
Betty White is planning to quit TV acting at 95 to check items off her bucket list!

RadarOnline.com can reveal the surprising things the TV legend, who won Emmys playing Sue Ann Nivens on The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, still plans to accomplish before hitting 100 — including Broadway theater, wild adventures and even romance!

After the cancellation of her TV series Hot in Cleveland in 2014, White’s telling pals she’s closing up shop.

“She feels she can live to 100 and has other things she wants to do with her life,” a friend says.

Topping her list is travel. Instead of visiting cushy resorts, she’s planning on a real adventure.

“Betty says she wants to go on an African safari,” reveals her pal.

“She also wants to spend more time with her friends before they all pass on.”

And she hasn’t totally given up on acting. Her true dream ­is to star on Broadway.

“That’s definitely on Betty’s bucket list,” the friend says. “She hasn’t done much live, on-stage work and she thinks it would be a perfect cap to her long career to appear on Broadway.”

The friend says Betty takes pen to paper nearly every day to finish a new memoir, and she’s also working on a script for a romantic comedy!

Since she has no children, she plans to leave her $45 million fortune to animal welfare groups founded by her husband, Allen Ludden, a game show host who died in 1981.

While she could still find work on TV, the source says Broadway is the only reason she’d return to acting.

“But if her acting career is over, she’s at peace with it. She wants to enjoy her time, without everyone fussing over her!” adds the pal.",fake,data/raw\overall\overall\celebrityDataset\fake\103fake.txt
